<br>
<br>¶1. (C) Summary:  With the January 25 constitutional 
<br>referendum rapidly approaching, all signs point to victory 
<br>for President Morales and his ruling Movement Toward 
<br>Socialism (MAS) party.  Although the opposition has made 
<br>
<br>inroads into the MAS lead, most national polls point to 
<br>between 54 and 60 percent support for the proposed 
<br>constitution (with one government poll showing 66 percent), 
<br>and the MAS appears set to leverage its considerable rural 
<br>base to victory.  After a series of national news articles 
<br>raised questions about significant fraud in the August 2008 
<br>recall referendum, the National Electoral Court has taken 
<br>pains to advertise the electoral rolls as secure.  However, a 
<br>recent poll shows less than half of the public shares the 
<br>
<br>court's confidence, and the opposition believes significant 
<br>electoral fraud is likely.  While cheating seems unnecessary 
<br>to secure victory for the MAS, padding their lead would give 
<br>the party leverage in congressional negotiations regarding 
<br>legislation implementing hundreds of vague constitutional 
<br>clauses.  Opposition leaders continue to fear the MAS will 
<br>use any stalemate in these negotiations to close congress and 
<br>institute rule by decree.  At both the national and regional 
<br>levels, the margin of victory matters.  A landslide for the 
<br>
<br>MAS nationally, or large victories for the opposition in the 
<br>eastern departments, could spark more conflict.  End summary.

<br>
<br>¶2. (C) With the January 25 constitutional referendum rapidly 
<br>approaching, all signs point to victory for President Morales 
<br>and his ruling Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. 
<br>
<br>Although the opposition has made inroads into their lead, 
<br>causing the MAS to tone down its rhetoric, national polls 
<br>point to between 54 and 60 percent support for the proposed 
<br>constitution.  (One government poll shows the "yes" vote 
<br>winning by 66 percent.)  However, many polls downplay or 
<br>ignore the MAS' rural base.  Almost as importantly, the MAS 
<br>seems prepared to take at least five of the nine departments, 
<br>including La Paz, Potosi, Oruro, Cochabamba, and Pando, with 
<br>Beni a distinct possibility.  If the MAS can win at levels 
<br>
<br>similar to their August 2008 referendum victory (i.e. 67 
<br>percent or more) and can make inroads into the "Media Luna" 
<br>or eastern half of the country, they will have much more 
<br>leverage in upcoming congressional negotiations over 
<br>implementing legislation.

<br>Polling Data

<br>
<br>
<br>¶3. (C) Polling data has varied widely over the past two 
<br>weeks, due to a combination of a tightening race and polling 
<br>methodologies (i.e. city vs. rural).  Recent national polls 
<br>by Gallup and Apoyo within the last week show approval for 
<br>the constitution with a much slimmer lead than many expected, 
<br>ahead only 48 to 42 percent and 49 to 43 percent, 
<br>respectively.  Ipsos and Mori both conducted polls of capital 
<br>cities and both found the "yes" vote ahead, with Ipsos 
<br>
<br>showing a 59 to 35 percent lead and Mori reporting 60 to 40 
<br>percent.  However, our contacts tell us all these polls 
<br>partially or totally ignored the rural vote, where the MAS 
<br>has much of its base.  A poll by Observatorio de Gestion 
<br>Publica, publicized by government-friendly Radio Patria 
<br>Nueva, marked the constitution's lead at 66 percent, versus 
<br>31 percent against.  Some estimate a six percent "bump" when 
<br>the rural vote is included. 
<br>
<br>
<br>¶4. (U) Polls showing a breakdown 
<br>by city or region indicate 
<br>the constitution will easily win in at least four 
<br>departments: La Paz, Potosi, Oruro, and Cochabamba, likely 
<br>with at least 70 percent support in each.  The MAS has a 
<br>distinct chance to capture both Pando and Beni as well.  In 
<br>Pando, the Observatorio poll shows Pando department split 
<br>evenly, and the Ipsos poll shows the capital city of Cobija 
<br>supporting the constitution by a ratio of 64 to 36.  Polling 
<br>
<br>data for Beni has been more scattershot, but although its 
<br>capital city of Trinidad is firmly against the constitution, 
<br>by as much as 88 percent, the larger city of Riberalta is 
<br>leaning for approval of the constitution.  The Observatorio 
<br>poll shows Beni evenly split as a department.

<br>
<br>
<br>¶5. (SBU) Although the opposition is making a mighty effort 
<br>across the country to rally against the constitution, the 
<br>forces of inertia seem to be conspiring against them, 
<br>particularly in the form of a largely uneducated rural base 
<br>in the Altiplano.  Leading daily La Razon interviewed several 
<br>community leaders from the Altiplano, and their supporters, 
<br>and reported on January 18 that neither the leaders nor the 
<br>supporters had read the Constitution.  Instead, the repeated 
<br>
<br>message was that rural communities would take their marching 
<br>orders from the MAS, and vote for the constitution. According 
<br>to the Ipso poll of capital cities, only four percent of 
<br>respondents said they had read much or all of the 
<br>constitution, 45 percent of respondents said they have read 
<br>some, and 50 percent said they had read none of the draft 
<br>text.  In the countryside, the number of those reading the 
<br>constitution is much lower.  Post suspects disinterest, blind 
<br>faith in Evo Morales' political project, and illiteracy, 
<br>
<br>despite the Cuban literacy program, all play a role.  In 
<br>addition, the sheer volume of the 411-article constitution 
<br>probably scares some potential readership away. 
<br>
<br>¶6. (C) However, despite the overall level of MAS dominance 
<br>among campesinos and indigenous voters, some opposition does 
<br>exist, albeit for a variety of reasons.  The xxxxxxxxxxxx, has tried to rally 
<br>support against the MAS and the proposed constitution (Reftel 
<br>
<br>A).  In a meeting with PolOffs, they lamented the way the MAS 
<br>had "cheated" and "fooled" campesinos into believing Morales 
<br>was himself truly indigenous or cared about indigenous 
<br>issues.  Although they held a national meeting on January 17 
<br>and tried to reach out to the press, they sounded defeated 
<br>when they acknowledged that the MAS, through a combination of 
<br>funding and pressure on local social and business leaders, 
<br>held a "vertical control" in the countryside that would be 
<br>difficult to break.  They also noted rural communities tended 
<br>
<br>to vote in blocks, supporting one political party until they 
<br>discarded it to vote en masse for another. 
<br>
<br>¶7. (C) Going in a completely different direction, some rural 
<br>social groups and far-left leaders, such as Achacachi Mayor 
<br>Eugenio Rojas and El Alto City Councilor Roberto de La Cruz 
<br>also publicly recommended voting against it because it was 
<br>seen as not revolutionary enough.  They criticized the 
<br>government for making too many concessions to the opposition 
<br>
<br>during the constitutional compromise reached on October 21, 
<br>including the agreement to not make land reform retroactive. 
<br>However, they have a relatively small following, and some, 
<br>like de La Cruz, eventually reversed course as the projected 
<br>MAS margin of victory shrunk in January.  Edgar Patana, 
<br>leader of the regional workers union (COR), other El Alto 
<br>union leaders, and the majority of social groups have 
<br>recommended voting for the constitution.

<br>
<br>¶8. (C) The opposition has not given up, but seems to be 
<br>battling 
<br>more to limit the margin of defeat than to win.  In 
<br>Santa Cruz,xxxxxxxxxxxx
<br>told EmbOff that polls show an overwhelming victory for the 
<br>
<br>"No" vote in Santa Cruz, but that he is worried about the 
<br>opposition's goal of winning in five of Bolivia's nine 
<br>departments (Reftel E).  Although a current 
<br>privately-commissioned opposition poll showed the 
<br>constitution ahead by a margin of only five points, 39 to 34 
<br>percent (with 20 percent undecided), opposition alternate 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx doubted the opposition would be able to 
<br>win the referendum outright even under the most optimistic 
<br>scenario.  He predicted that Morales would succeed in 
<br>
<br>personalizing the constitution as "Evo's constitution" and 
<br>leverage his cult of personality.  Ultimately xxxxxxxxxxxx was more 
<br>concerned with the margin of the opposition's defeat and 
<br>discrediting the results of "any election that uses this 
<br>voter roll" (Reftel C). 
<br>
<br>¶9. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx has been 
<br>criss-crossing the country with opposition xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx, campaigning against the proposed constitution, but 
<br>
<br>also building a foundation for a likely run for the 
<br>presidency. xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed opposition leaders put aside 
<br>jockeying to be the 2009 opposition unity presidential 
<br>candidate in the final days of the "no" campaign to "attack 
<br>the government from three sides:" the prefects (governors) 
<br>who been traveling around the Media Luna to show &they are 
<br>not afraid" of government threats to arrest them and 
<br>galvanize support in opposition departments, a group of three 
<br>
<br>presidential contenders to show opposition unity and 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx, who is used for more cerebral attacks on the CPE 
<br>and to &dismiss the governments mythology that they 
<br>exclusively represent the indigenous.8  xxxxxxxxxxxx noted that 
<br>opposition parties Podemos and MNR are playing a deliberately 
<br>muted role, recognizing that their unpopular association with 
<br>the &old regimes8 would play into MAS strategy.  "Political 
<br>
<br>parties are bad words in Bolivia," xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx La 
<br>Paz-based group of mostly young professionals who focus on 
<br>issues and distance themselves from the party moniker.  "We 
<br>need parties, but we need to start from scratch, without the 
<br>old leaders.  This will take time." 
<br>
<br>¶10. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx told 
<br>PolOff the opposition is chipping away at the MAS referendum 
<br>
<br>lead despite the government's leviathan advantage in 
<br>resources by de-personalizing the constitution and 
<br>"convincing people on the street that is not in their best 
<br>interests."  Although he conceded the "no" campaign would 
<br>ultimately be a losing effort, he cited the emerging feud 
<br>between Morales and Church, corruption charges against 
<br>government officials, and the increasingly precarious economy 
<br>as emerging factors in December and January that created an 
<br>opposition "surge" after "we were so depressed" in the fall. 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx said that the government's newfound mobilization of 
<br>congressmen and deputies to challenge the opposition view on 
<br>television and radio shows is proof of government panic. 
<br>"Before they just thought they could ignore us (and win)," 
<br>said xxxxxxxxxxxx.  "They said there was no opposition." xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>agreed, and added that this is playing into the opposition's 
<br>hands, because they "are forced to defend a constitution they 
<br>often know little about."  According to xxxxxxxxxxxx has 
<br>been challenging MAS supporters to debate him during his 
<br>
<br>speaking tours and embarrassed Vice Minister of Social Groups 
<br>Sacha Llorenti in a January 20 debate when he started talking 
<br>in fluent Aymara.  He asked the dumbstruck Llorenti what he 
<br>planned to do if the constitution passed, since all public 
<br>officials will be required to speak one of Bolivia's 
<br>indigenous languages.  Later he challenged President Morales 
<br>to debate him in Aymara, which the president allegedly speaks 
<br>poorly.

<br>
<br>
<br>¶11. (C) The National Electoral Court (CNE), which will 
<br>oversee and ratify the results of the referendum, has 
<br>undertaken a public relations campaign to assure the public 
<br>of the security of the election rolls, which came under 
<br>scrutiny after leading daily La Razon published a series of 
<br>
<br>articles questioning the validity of the August 10, 2008 
<br>recall referendum.  Several contacts, including xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx, told us the MAS padded their 
<br>August referendum victory by five to seven points through 
<br>fraud at several levels (reftel C).  While many international 
<br>observers groups are expected to view the January 25 
<br>constitutional referendum -- including the European Union, 
<br>the OAS, the Carter Center, the UN, the CAN, the 
<br>South-American and Andean parliaments, and UNASUR (septel) -- 
<br>
<br>the depth of the earlier fraud has muted the opposition's 
<br>confidence in observers' ability to ensure the results are 
<br>fair.  Members of the Santa Cruz civic committee told EmbOff 
<br>that they have no faith in international observers.  The 
<br>committee has met with the OAS team already and "told our 
<br>side of the story", describing the discoveries of tens of 
<br>thousands of false voter cards and the statistical signs of 
<br>fraud in areas that managed to vote 100 percent for President 
<br>Morales in the August 2008 referendum.  However, the civic 
<br>
<br>committee said that the fact that international observers 
<br>blessed the August referendum means they do not expect an 
<br>honest review of the constitutional referendum.  Civic 
<br>committee members also noted that small numbers of observers, 
<br>generally based in the city, will not be able to stop 
<br>widespread fraud in the countryside, which is where they 
<br>believe most of the August 10 fraud took place. 
<br>
<br>¶12. (C) In a press conference designed to bolster confidence 
<br>
<br>in the security of the electoral rolls, National Electoral 
<br>Court (CNE) President Jose Luis Exeni presented a PowerPoint 
<br>describing the bill of clean health given by the OAS.  As 
<br>part of the presentation, he showed the number of voters 
<br>dropped from the rolls for not participating in prior 
<br>elections and the number added during this cycle.  While all 
<br>departments projected to vote against the constitution had a 
<br>net reduction in the voter rolls, including 85,000 Crucenos 
<br>and 17,000 Benianos, MAS strongholds including La Paz 
<br>
<br>(38,000) and Potosi (16,000) saw substantial gains -- a 
<br>curious reckoning, considering population and migration 
<br>trends to the contrary.

<br>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br>
<br>¶13. (C) While it is possible the constitution could pass in 
<br>Beni, most opposition leaders tell us the MAS has set its 
<br>
<br>sights on lightly-populated Pando department as its best 
<br>chance to win in five departments.  By winning the popular 
<br>vote and a majority of the departments, the MAS could more 
<br>credibly claim to have support throughout the country.  Pando 
<br>has also traditionally aligned with the opposition, so a 
<br>breakthrough win there would send a strong signal that the 
<br>strength of the MAS continues to rise.  And with fewer than 
<br>32,000 registered voters, or less than one percent of the 
<br>country's voting population, Pando is the most vulnerable 
<br>
<br>department to even small amounts of fraud or voter 
<br>registration changes. 
<br>
<br>¶14. (C) In a conversation with PolOff, xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx alleged the MAS deliberately fomented unrest in Pando 
<br>in September to justify a military siege, depose Prefect 
<br>Leopoldo Fernandez, and arrest opposition-aligned leaders to 
<br>swing the balance of power to the MAS in the Senate.  Besides 
<br>disabling the opposition's ability to campaign by arresting 
<br>
<br>many of its leaders,xxxxxxxxxxxx alleged the government crackdown 
<br>changed Pando's electoral map by causing hundreds of 
<br>opposition voters to flee to Brazil while importing 2,000 new 
<br>security forces, which xxxxxxxxxxxx claimed were likely MAS voters 
<br>from the Altiplano (Reftel B).  xxxxxxxxxxxx added 
<br>that in the run-up to the August 2008 referendum, Government 
<br>Minister Alfredo Rada facilitated the establishment of fake 
<br>identities via the police role in issuing national identity 
<br>cards (which can then be used to vote).  (Reftel C).

<br>
<br>¶15. (C) xxxxxxxxxxxx told PolOff December 31 that 
<br>a general election prompted by passage of the new 
<br>constitution requires a plethora of enabling legislation that 
<br>the opposition-controlled Senate will block, at least in the 
<br>forms likely to be proposed by the MAS (Reftel B).  xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>
<br>said the new draft constitution is deliberately vague, which 
<br>grants MAS legislators wide discretion to "fill in the 
<br>blanks" with new implementing legislation.  He also said the 
<br>Senate would clash with the government on assigning new 
<br>borders for electoral districts, needed for the general 
<br>election.  xxxxxxxxxxxx added that Morales' MAS party is 
<br>already injecting "ridiculous" interpretations of the 
<br>constitution into a wide gamut of implementing legislation 
<br>that "the Senate cannot in good conscious agree to."  He said 
<br>
<br>Senate rejection of MAS proposals provides a ready excuse for 
<br>Morales to dismiss congress for "rejecting the will of the 
<br>people" and then have President Morales rule by decree 
<br>(Reftel D). 
<br>
<br>¶16. (C) Despite the official government position that 
<br>President Morales will undergo treatment to correct a 
<br>deviated septum immediately following the referendum, several 
<br>contacts confirm that the problem is actually a tumor in the 
<br>
<br>pituitary near the sella turcica and that Morales will travel 
<br>to Spain for the operation.  xxxxxxxxxxxx 
<br>xxxxxxxxxxxx told us Morales' first choice, Cuba, could not 
<br>perform the surgery.  Article 238 is also of consequence to 
<br>the post-January 25 political landscape.  It would establish 
<br>that all other government officials must stand down three 
<br>months before general elections expected in 2009, with the 
<br>notable exception of the president and vice president. 
<br>Besides providing the MAS the advantage of ruling during the 
<br>
<br>campaign, it also ensures leadership cannot pass to the 
<br>opposition-controlled Senate.  It is unclear why the 
<br>opposition waited until the final week before the referendum 
<br>to complain about the article or why they accepted it during 
<br>marathon sessions in October to arrive at a "compromise 
<br>text," which, it should be noted, the opposition agreed to 
<br>under duress, with thousands of MAS-aligned protesters 
<br>surrounding the congress and threatening violence.

<br>
<br>¶17. (C) It is likely there will be some amount of fraud in a 
<br>referendum the MAS seems likely to win legitimately anyway. 
<br>While it can be difficult to separate fact from fiction, the 
<br>Morales administration has a reputation of doing exactly what 
<br>they announce they will do.  In this case, 66 percent seems 
<br>
<br>to be the target number, and the MAS is likely to pull out 
<br>all the stops to reach that level.  With at least two-thirds 
<br>support across the country and a minimum of five of the nine 
<br>departments under his belt, President Morales would be able 
<br>to claim a political mandate to implement the constitution 
<br>quickly.  Practically speaking, this will put great pressure 
<br>on the Congress, especially the opposition-controlled Senate, 
<br>to acquiesce in negotiations and accept MAS versions of 
<br>implementation legislation.  If they do not, Morales and 
<br>
<br>others in the MAS have spoken of rule by decree.  Using 
<br>similar logic, Morales could call for early elections to more 
<br>quickly advance the "democratic revolution" in Bolivia. 
<br>Early elections would also help the MAS avoid dealing with 
<br>the quickly-crumbling economy, which would likely be more of 
<br>an issue in December. 
<br>
<br>¶18. (C) Both sides seem to be angling over the margin of the 
<br>MAS victory, not the victory itself.  While Morales continues 
<br>
<br>to predict a victory of up to 80 percent, Vice President 
<br>Garcia 
<br>Linera tried to manage expectations with a 66 percent 
<br>estimate on January 21.  The margin matters.  If the 
<br>constitution gets less than two-thirds support, many 
<br>observers feel this would represent a relative defeat, 
<br>especially when Morales himself has set such high 
<br>expectations.  On the other hand, we are equally concerned 
<br>that large-margin victories in media luna departments could 
<br>
<br>lead opposition leaders to ignore the national results and 
<br>resume a course for autonomy on their own terms -- putting 
<br>them on a collision course with the national government.  A 
<br>solid but not overwhelming MAS victory, perhaps around 56 to 
<br>60 percent, might be the best outcome to keep both sides from 
<br>claiming a strong mandate for extreme measures.
