¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Venezuelan doctors have accused the Venezuelan 
Government (GBRV) of politicizing health care at the expense of the 
health of Venezuelans. In recent months, protests have paralyzed 
hospitals across Venezuela as doctors and patients have complained 
of shortages of medical supplies, delays in hospital renovations 
and unpaid wages and benefits. Observers describe public hospitals 
as increasingly dangerous places where underpaid, undersupplied, 
and understaffed doctors struggle to provide medical services to 
Venezuela's poor. Critics say that the GBRV has created a parallel 
medical system-"Barrio Adentro"-that has sucked resources away from 
the traditional hospital network and reduced the overall quality of 
medical services. The GBRV has suspended doctors for speaking out 
about the crisis while giving former military officers and 
community councils a greater role in hospital administration. On 
November 29, President Chavez announced plans to eliminate a 
government health care benefit that pays for public workers to 
receive health care at private clinics, a move that would place 
even greater strain on already overburdened public hospitals. END 
SUMMARY. 



HOSPTIAL CRISIS SPREADS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 



¶2. (SBU) In recent months, newspapers across Venezuela have 
carried daily reports of a growing crisis in the public hospitals. 
On November 30, for example, "Notitarde" published reports of a 
vigil by patients and doctors to protest shortages of medicines and 
supplies at the Enrique Tejera Hospital; on December 1, Ciudad 
Guayana's "Correo del Caroni" covered the "technical closure" of 
the Negra Hipolita Maternity Ward after the breakdown of the air 
conditioning system raised concerns that the heat would increase 
bacteria levels in the incubators for newborn babies; and on 
December 4, the daily "El Universal" reported that doctors in 
Merida had shut down the University Hospital of Los Andes (HULA) 
due to medical supply shortages, pronouncing the hospital "dead." 



DOCTORS PROTEST DETERIORATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS 



¶3. (SBU) On November 18, in a development representative of the 
breakdown of public hospitals across the country, the Jesus Yerena 
de Lidice Hospital shut down after 140 physicians announced their 
mass resignation. Lidice is one of the two largest and most 
important public hospitals in the impoverished Catia municipality 
of Caracas; it serves a poor and marginalized community that 
otherwise has little access to health care. 



¶4. (SBU) For over three months, Lidice's patients and doctors have 
protested shortages of medical supplies, delays in the renovation 
of hospital wards, and unpaid wages and benefits. But the conflict 
escalated on November 16, when the Health Ministry suspended four 
of Lidice's doctors after charging them with inciting protests 
among the patients. Lidice's doctors resigned en masse after the 
Health Ministry refused to reinstate the four suspended doctors and 
resume negotiations over salary payments and benefits owed since 
¶2007. The resignations paralyzed Lidice, leaving only two 
doctors-an internal specialist and a surgeon-to care for the 
remaining patients. 



¶5. (SBU) Although Lidice reopened on November 20 after the Health 
and Labor Ministry agreed to reinstate the four suspended 
physicians and resume negotiations over other demands, the 

CARACAS 00001551 002 OF 004 


emergency pediatrics unit and maternity ward remain closed for 
renovation. The maternity ward of the Lidice hospital-considered 
the second most important in Caracas for many years-has now been 
closed for two years, while Catia's other major public hospital, 
Los Magallanes Jose Gregorio Hernandez, has been partially closed 
for over a year while awaiting renovation. 



PUBLIC HOSPITALS ARE DANGEROUS, UNDERSUPPLIED, AND UNDERSTAFFED 



¶6. (C) During a private meeting on November 10,
XXXXXXXXXXXX, a health reporter for the "El Universal" 
newspaper, described the public hospitals as increasingly dangerous 
places, where underpaid, undersupplied, and understaffed doctors 
work in unsanitary conditions to provide medical services to 
Venezuela's poor. Due to shortages of basic medical supplies, 
doctors ask patients to purchase their own needles, disinfectants 
and gauze. XXXXXXXXXXXX told EmbOffs that doctors sometimes dress wounds 
with the same dirty bandages. Other patients are told to bring 
their own X-rays from private clinics. As in many areas of 
Caracas, public hospitals suffer from water shortages, forcing 
doctors to postpone important operations. In some of the older 
public hospitals, the plumbing systems cannot pump water above the 
first few floors of the building. 



¶7. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX estimated that medical residents in public hospitals 
make an average of 2,000 bolivars (BsF) per month (USD 930 at the 
official rate of 2.15 BsF to the dollar). According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, over 
fifty percent of the resident doctors move to the capital from 
other parts of the country, and their salary is barely enough to 
cover rent in Caracas, where an austere apartment in a dangerous 
neighbourhood can easily cost 1,800 bolivars per month. 
Consequently, many doctors have left the public hospitals in search 
of other jobs, while some of the most qualified have left the 
country to earn better salaries abroad. In a December 4 press 
report, the Venezuelan Medical Federation (FMV) estimated that the 
public hospitals are understaffed by 43 percent. 



¶8. (C) Crime has further contributed to the flight of doctors from 
the public sector. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that criminals go to the public 
hospitals to rob, steal, and even kill patients. The emergency 
room in Hospital Vargas is only open for twelve hours-between seven 
in the morning and seven at night-because of security concerns. In 
October, a shootout in the emergency room of the Los Magallanes de 
Catia hospital killed two people. Although the Ministry of Health 
has promised to send more guards to protect the hospitals, in many 
cases the additional security has not arrived. 



SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL 



¶9. (C) On November 17, XXXXXXXXXXXX told EconOff that the GBRV has 
suspended doctors to discourage them from speaking out about the 
health care crisis. Last year four doctors were suspended when 
they exposed the accidental death of six babies in a maternity 
ward. According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the GBRV has limited the role of the 
resident doctors in hospital management and transferred authority 
to local community councils. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that community council 
members meet with hospital directors to discuss renovation 
proposals. On November 10, the director for the Vargas Hospital of 
Caracas, Francisco Hernandez, told the press that he had to present 
the hospital's renovation proposals to the community councils 
before sending them to the Health Ministry and President Chavez for 
approval.

BARRIO ADENTRO DRAINS RESOURCES FROM PUBLIC HOSPITALS 



¶10. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX told EmbOffs that the quality of health care in the 
public hospitals has deteriorated as the GBRV has redirected 
resources to "Barrio Adentro," a program staffed by the Cuban 
Government that provides free medical services in poor areas (Ref 
A). Although "Barrio Adentro" has translated into political gains 
for President Chavez, its medical impact is questionable, despite 
having received massive government investment (Note: The GBRV spent 
approximately USD 5.6 billion on Cuban medical assistance, 
training, medicines, vaccines, and other services in 2008, 
according to one estimate. See Ref A for further analysis of 
Barrio Adentro. End Note.). While Chavez has acknowledged a 
"crisis" in "Barrio Adentro" and announced a sweeping campaign to 
revitalize the program, neither President Chavez nor his ministers 
have announced new plans for additional investment in the 
traditional public hospital system. 



¶11. (C) On October 5, the President of the Venezuelan Medical 
Federation (FMV) XXXXXXXXXXXX told EmbOffs that
the health care problem is primarily political. 
According to XXXXXXXXXXXX, the GBRV has focused resources on the 
development of a parallel medical system-"Barrio Adentro" -that has 
sucked investment away from the hospitals and the traditional 
medical infrastructure to the detriment of the health of 
Venezuelans. At the same time, the GBRV has appointed military 
professionals with no medical background to important positions in 
the Ministry of Health. XXXXXXXXXXXX said that there is "anarchy" in the 
Ministry of Health, pointing out that the GBRV has released health 
statistics just four times in the last 14 months. FMV Vice 
XXXXXXXXXXXX  added that vaccination rates have 
decreased dramatically over the past several years. 



¶12. (C) While the GBRV has prioritized "Barrio Adentro" over the 
traditional medical system, Venezuelans seem to prefer public 
hospitals or private clinics. On October 9, XXXXXXXXXXXX
told EmbOffs that the majority of Venezuelans 
continue to receive medical care in public hospitals or private 
clinics rather than "Barrio Adentro." XXXXXXXXXXXX cited a 2006 study 
by a team of European Union analysts that measured the use of 
health services by sector (i.e., public hospitals, private clinics, 
or "Barrio Adentro") and confirmed that poorer Venezuelans were 
more likely to receive medical care in public hospitals than 
"Barrio Adentro." 



CHAVEZ THREATENS TO ELIMINATE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFIT 



¶13. (SBU) On November 29, in a move that further illustrated GBRV 
efforts to strengthen "Barrio Adentro" as an alternative to the 
traditional medical system, Chavez announced his intention to 
eliminate the hospitalization, surgery, and maternity (HCM) benefit 
that public sector employees use to pay for health care at private 
clinics. During a broadcast of the "Hello, President" radio and 
television program, Chavez said that the HCM benefit supported the 
"bourgeoisie" owners of private clinics and that public employees 
should instead use "Barrio Adentro's" network of Integral 
Diagnostic Centers. In press reports the following day, public 
employees in the petroleum, iron, steel, and aluminum sectors 
protested the announcement (Note: According to one press report, 
sixty percent of the 12 million Venezuelans with health insurance 
work in the public sector. End Note.). Critics pointed out that 
the private clinics offer medical services that "Barrio Adentro" 

CARACAS 00001551 004 OF 004 


does not provide, and that the public hospitals do not have the 
capacity to absorb a massive influx of new patients from the 
private clinics. On September 23, deputies for the pro-Chavez 
United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) told EmbOffs that 
changes to the medical insurance system would be imposed 
progressively given the sensitivity of the issue (Ref B). 



COMMENT 



¶14. (C) The quality of health care in Venezuela has declined as 
the GBRV has shifted resources from the traditional medical system 
to "Barrio Adentro." Resource-starved public hospitals are 
beginning to show the effects of years of neglect. Mismanagement 
has increased as military officers and community council 
members-usually with little previous experience in health care-have 
assumed a greater role in the administration of public hospitals. 
At the same time, the hospitals suffer from the same problems that 
plague the rest of Venezuelan society, including the deterioration 
of infrastructure, an increase in crime, and the flight of the 
professional class. Despite these issues, President Chavez and 
other members of his cabinet have not publicly acknowledged the 
deterioration of the public hospitals or announced any new plans to 
revitalize them. To the extent that President Chavez has 
acknowledged Venezuela's health care crisis, the GBRV has looked to 
"Barrio Adentro" and Cuba-and not the public hospitals-as the 
solution. 



¶15. (C) Meanwhile, "Barrio Adentro" has not proven to be a viable 
substitute for the public hospitals despite massive GBRV attention 
and investment. Indeed, the evidence suggests that all classes of 
Venezuelans continue to prefer public hospitals to "Barrio 
Adentro," even as the quality of medical services in the former has 
deteriorated. The popular preference for public hospitals means 
that the traditional medical system must treat a growing number of 
patients with dwindling resources, a problem that will only 
intensify if the GBRV decides to eliminate the health care benefit 
for public employees, forcing them out of the private clinics and 
into the public hospitals. Another possible consequence is the 
risk that the GBRV will look to expropriate private sector medical 
facilities.
