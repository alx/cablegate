SUBJECT:  IS THE MIGHTY MENGASH MOSCOW BOUND? 
 
REF:  KUWAIT 1199 
 
UAE Information Minister Abdullah bin Zayid called 
the Ambassador 4/14 with a postscript to the tale 
of the "mighty" Mengash -- the scrappy Iraqi farmer 
who "shot down" an Apache with a vintage WWI rifle 
in the first days of the war and became a cult hero 
in much of the Arab world.   Apparently an Abu 
Dhabi TV crew sought Mengash out the other day for 
an interview.  When approached by the Emirati 
journalists, a paranoid Mengash refused to go on 
camera, claiming "the Americans" were looking for 
him and he was now seeking "political asylum" in 
Russia.  If he made it to Moscow, Mengash promised 
Abu Dhabi TV an exclusive.  An amused Abdullah 
swore the story was true.
