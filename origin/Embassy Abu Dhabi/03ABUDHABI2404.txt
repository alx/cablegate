SUBJECT:  EXPAT SHI'A DELIVER THANK-YOU FOR IRAQ LIBERATION 
 
¶1.  Two expat Iraqi Shi'a professionals (both long resident in 
the UAE) called on A/DCM May 19 to deliver a letter of thanks 
from their community here for the liberation of Iraq.  84 self- 
styled "Iraqi Shi'a intellectuals" (mostly doctors and engineers) 
signed a letter (text in para three) expressing their 
appreciation for the ouster of Saddam and calling for the U.S. to 
remain in Iraq as long as necessary to establish a democratic 
government.  In presenting their letter/petition, the two doctors 
(one an orthodontist, the other a psychiatrist) said they have 
been deeply disturbed by television images of angry Iraqi Shi'a 
demonstrating against the U.S. presence, which they felt did not 
represent the true feelings of the Iraqi Shi'a community.  They 
said that the expat Shi'a community in the UAE strongly supports 
a democratic government with a clear separation of mosque and 
state -- which they argued would be the most appropriate form of 
government for historically secular Iraq.  A/DCM thanked the two 
Iraqi doctors for their letter and agreed to stay in touch 
regarding matters of concern to their community.

Her Excellency the American Ambassador in the UAE 
 
Dear Ms. Ambassador 
 
We the Iraqi Shi'a intellectuals in Abu Dhabi and the rest of the 
Emirates wish to express our views regarding the current events 
in our country. 
 
We begin by conveying our high appreciation through your 
Excellency to the American administration and the American people 
for having helped the Iraqi people to demolish the cruel and 
corrupted regime of Saddam Hussein.  Further more, we think that 
the continued support of coalition forces is crucial until the 
establishment of a democratically elected permanent government. 
 
We highly respect the sacrifices made by the American and 
coalition forces.  Were it not for their action, the criminal 
regime would have continued to preside over Iraq for decades to 
come destroying Iraqi society, its values and norms while robbing 
the people of their country's wealth. 
 
In spite of our respect for the Shi'a clergymen in Iraq, some of 
them are not representing our views.  We are not in agreement 
with their political opinions concerning the American government 
and the future of Iraq. 
 
We believe that after long years of suffering under tyranny and 
dictatorship, Iraqis deserve a free democratic country reflecting 
the entire Iraqi mosaic.  In this regard we seek your help in 
preventing some countries, Arab and non-Arab alike, from 
interfering with the process of building the future of Iraq and 
its democracy. 
 
Thank you with best regards. 
 
Yours, 
 
The Undersigned
