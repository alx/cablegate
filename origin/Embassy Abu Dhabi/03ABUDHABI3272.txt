SUBJECT:  UAEG OFFERS TO HOST OCTOBER DONORS CONFERENCE 
 
¶1. (U) The UAE representative to the weekly Iraq 
reconstruction teleconference had provisionally offered to 
have the UAE host the October donors' conference for Iraq. 
In a meeting with the Ambassador, Minstate for Foreign 
Affairs Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed said that the UAEG is 
formally offering to host the conference in Abu Dhabi and 
would like USG support for the initiative.  He said that 
Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed had 
officially blessed the proposal and wants to hold it in Abu 
Dhabi. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment and Action Request:  Post understands that 
there has been some discussion of the venue for the 
conference.  We believe that the UAE would be an 
appropriate host for the conference.  The UAE has the 
advantage of its regional location and good air 
connections.  As the only Arab member of the "core group", 
it can provide an additional level of legitimacy in the 
Arab world for efforts to rebuild Iraq.  Post recommends 
strongly that the USG consider supporting the UAEG offer. 
End Comment and Action Request.
