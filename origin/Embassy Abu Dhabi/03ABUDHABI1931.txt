REF: ABU DHABI 1901 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  UAE President Shaykh Zayid Al-Nayhan ordered the 
UAE Armed Forces on 4/21 to immediately provide 
potable water to the Iraqi city of Basra.  Press 
reports confirm that the UAE Armed Forces are planning 
to build a desalination plant on the Shatt Al-Arab 
with a capacity of 250,000 gallons a day.  The UAE Red 
Crescent Authority already is providing 20,000 gallons 
a day of potable water to the residents of Basra, 
according to press reports. 
 
¶2.  Comment: The UAEG continues to look for ways to 
assist the Iraqi people, with both immediate and 
longer-term needs.  The offer of a desalination plant 
should help Iraq's second largest city ameliorate an 
historic water deficit.  We are checking with the Red 
Crescent on the modalities of transporting and setting 
up this facility.  End comment.
