--------- SRI LANKA ---------

1.QWAR ENDS, BUT ISSUES STILL ALIVE,Q editorial in May 20 centrist Gujarati daily, JANMABHOOMI: QThe 30-year old violent ethnic struggle for a separate Tamil state in Sri Lanka may have ended, but it would be erroneous to infer that this will lead to a lasting peace. The Sri Lankan Rajapakse government faces an uphill task of restoring the dignity of Tamils and bringing them into the mainstream.

2.QPRABHAKARANQS DEATH BRINGS DOWN THE CURTAINS ON WAR,Q editorial in May 21 centrist Gujarati daily, GUJARATMITRA: QThe basic concerns behind the Tamil struggle in Sri Lanka were legitimate and remain so. It is unfair for the Tamil-speaking minority to be considered second-class citizens, although the Liberation Tigers of Tamil EelamQs (LTTEQs) violent means were not just. The Sri Lankan government now has to stop the LTTE from regrouping.

3.QEND OF TERROR,Q editorial in May 20 Hindi daily, DAINIK JAGRAN: QIt is worrisome that some Tamils are trying to create a hero-like image of Prabhakaran after his death. The Sri Lankan government needs to take immediate measures to protect Tamil interests in order to prevent another Tamil terrorist uprising. India will have to ensure that the Sri Lankan government gets into action.

4.QDOLLAR ATTRACTING POLICIES,Q editorial in May 20 right-of-center Urdu daily, HINDUSTAN EXPRESS: QPakistan is using the presence of the Taliban in the tribal border areas to extract dollars from the United States. With the motive of selling the fear of the Taliban, extremists like Baitullah Mehsood, Maulvi Fazlullah and Muslim Khan were allowed to recoup and strengthen themselves militarily.

5.QSUCCESS OF OPERATION SWAT,Q editorial in May 20 right-of-center Urdu daily, RASHTRIYA SAHARA: QIn the middle of so many problems, PakistanQs relations with its bigger neighbors like India are also souring. The activities of the Taliban and other such outfits seem to be threatening the very social fabric of the country. Political think-tanks are increasingly predicting the failure of the Pakistani state. Had Pakistan not put up a strong face against terrorism, the entire country would have had to bear the consequences. This is the reason why Pakistani NEW DELHI 00001036 002 OF 002 President Zardari appears to be determined for success in Swat.

6.QWHERE IS PAKISTAN GOING?Q commentary in May 20 Hindi daily, DAINIK JAGRAN: QThe TalibanQs anarchy in Pakistan is a matter of serious concern for the entire world, especially for the U.S. as the United States has been providing economic aid to Pakistan for decades. The Pakistani army got activated only after U.S. President ObamaQs warning. Now the Pakistani citizens must decide what they want -- a backward and radical society, or a democratic system.

7.QPOPE BENEDICT AND POLITICIANS,Q editorial in May 20 right-of-center Urdu daily, HAMARA SAMAJ: QPope Benedict has remained a mute spectator to the killings of civilians in Palestine for so long. Should he not have condemned the bombardments and killings of innocent civilians? America always favors the strong and has no concern for the victimized. If the Pope desired, he could have stopped many wars.
