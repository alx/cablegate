¶1. EconCouns passed reftel talking points to Department of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Deputy Director for 
Trade Remedies Mike Robertson on February 20. Robertson noted 
significant overlap between the U.S. goals and the GOC's 
objectives for the February 24-25 Study Group meeting.  He 
said Canada and the United States had exchanged papers and he 
had seen several other countries' comments as well. 
 
¶2. Based on the positive outcome of the December meeting and 
the good work he had seen since, Robertson was optimistic 
that next week's meeting would make substantial progress 
toward effective discipline of steel subsidies.  He did note 
a couple of areas that, in Canada's view, were not ripe for 
discussion.  For example, said Robertson, Canada will not 
take a position on enforcement mechanisms until the GOC is 
clear on what is being enforced.  Similarly, Robertson said 
there was no way of knowing what kind of special and 
differential (S&D) treatment should be offered and to whom 
without knowing the range of agreed disciplines to which the 
non-S&D participants were willing to submit. 
 
¶3.  Robertson welcomed the expression of U.S. gratitude for 
effective NAFTA solidarity at the December meeting, agreeing 
that it had been a factor in increasing the momentum of the 
OECD effort.  He also praised the hard work of the OECD 
secretariat in pressing participants for written comment.
