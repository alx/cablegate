¶1. (C) Summary: Political grandstanding by parliamentarians
opposed to the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program gave way to
a late-night announcement of a compromise during the second
day of debates. At the invitation of Parliament, cabinet
members, including PM Balkenende, responded to questions on
the floor of the Parliament. The Dutch will proceed with the
acquisition of one test aircraft and will delay the decision
to purchase operational aircraft until 2012, but the Labor
party has been damaged from the debate. End Summary.
¶2. (SBU) COMPROMISE: At the beginning of the evening debate
on April 23, the Labor Party (PvdA) floorleader put forth a
joint resolution by the governing coalition that was
obviously the result of a high level compromise. The
resolution, approved by parliament at the end of debate,
stated: ""... that the choice to participate in the
operational test phase is not a definitive choice for the
JSF; ... (we) limit the decision process at this moment to
making commitments ..for the first ... test aircraft... the
final choice for participation in the test phase may be made
in 2010 ... a decision made be made for termination... on the
basis of ... pricing, (aircraft) noise ... and the outcome of
arbitration of the business case ... a final procurement
decision on production aircraft will be taken in 2012.""
¶3. (C) POLITICAL REACTION: PM Balkenende was satisfied with
the compromise as it permits the Netherlands to continue to
participate in the test phase ""and it is the result that
counts."" State Secretary De Vries stated that ""the approach
that has been chosen fits into the previous agreements on the
orders."" Christian Democrats floorleader Pieter Van Geel
emphasized that this commitment is ""an important signal to
the partners and industry."" The opposition claimed that they
""scored on the point that the final decision is delayed until
2012.""
¶4. (C) COMMENT: Both sides have claimed victory but the
primary spoils must go to the supporters of JSF. The Dutch
have taken another step that continues their engagement as
partners in the JSF program. The PvdA has been ridiculed in
the press, and the party may now be on the hunt for victories
elsewhere. Opposition to the JSF Program in the Netherlands
will continue to be vigorous, but maturation of the JSF
program and firmer cost estimates will support proponents.
END COMMENT.
