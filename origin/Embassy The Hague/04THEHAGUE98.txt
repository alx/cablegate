¶1.     (SBU) Post re-delivered talking points on the IFC 
Small Business Fund for Iraq to Netherlands Ministry of 
Finance Official Ammarens Bruggenkamp.  Ms. Bruggenkamp said 
she still does not have a definite GONL position on IFC 
funding but would re-submit the request for consideration at 
the MOF. 
 
¶2.     (SBU) Post notes that Finance Minister Zalm will have 
a pull-aside meeting with U/S Larson at Davos.  We suggest 
that this meeting might be a good opportunity to raise the 
question of Dutch support for the IFC.
