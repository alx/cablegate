SUBJECT: ROCA, SANCHEZ RAP USINT'S INTERNET-ACCESS POLICY 
 
REF: HAVANA 8769 
 
Classified By: COM Michael Parmly for Reason 1.4(d). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: XXXXXXXXXXX on April 18 requested a 
meeting with COM, without declaring the reason.  At the April 
24 meeting, they presented a list of 10 independent 
journalists banned from USINT's two Internet Centers since 
2004, saying they had been unfairly blacklisted.  XXXXXXXXXXX
called the bans excessive and said they amount to a 
professional death blow for independent journalists.  They 
called on USINT to reconsider its punishment.  The 10 are 
among a relatively small number of Cubans whose Internet 
privileges were revoked for repeatedly disturbing other 
users, mistreating USINT staffers or committing other 
offenses.  COM explained that access to our Internet centers 
requires appropriate conduct.  The two dissidents and COM 
also discussed the Santiago/Havana divide, the transfer of 
Gustavo Machin, and what keeps Fidel Castro up until three in 
the morning.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) XXXXXXXXXXX, requested a meeting with COM.  At the April 
24 meeting, they criticized USINT's practice of banning 
visits to our Internet Centers by Cubans who repeatedly 
create disturbances there.  The two handed COM a one-page 
letter containing the names of 10 independent journalists who 
they described as "people of proven political and civil 
credibility" who "work every day for democracy in Cuba" but 
who since 2004 have been denied access to USINT's two 
Internet-access facilities.  In a possible swipe at fellow 
activist XXXXXXXXXXX, with whom he has had a falling 
out, XXXXXXXXXXX complained that USINT officials apparently 
blacklisted some or all of the 10 in 2004 after conferring 
with XXXXXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXXXXX.  He said 
many of the independent journalists were blacklisted after 
failing to write about XXXXXXXXXXX to Promote Civil 
Society, or writing about it in an unfavorable light.  XXXXXXXXXXX
asked the COM to reconsider the bans, calling 
them draconian and saying they put independent journalists -- 
already tormented by the GOC -- in a double bind. 
 
COM DEFENDS NEED FOR DISCIPLINE 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) The COM accepted the note and promised to discuss its 
contents with other USINT staffers, who he characterized as 
committed to fair play.  However, he defended the need for 
discipline at USINT's Internet centers and said USINT does 
not play favorites or politics with regard to access to the 
Lincoln or Roosevelt Centers.   The COM noted that USINT is 
encouraging other countries with a diplomatic presence in 
Havana to offer Internet access.  (Note: The Norwegian 
Embassy provides Internet access to some Cubans through one 
computer terminal.  The Dutch are reportedly planning a 
center, while the British and Czechs are said to be 
considering such a move.  The Canadians are planning an 
Internet center with some eight computers.  End note.) 
 
CUBA'S EAST/WEST DIVIDE 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Discussion then turned to the physical and 
psychological divide between Havana, in the West, and 
Santiago in the East.  XXXXXXXXXXX, just back from a trip to his 
native XXXXXXXXXXX, said the city is virtually garbage-free, 
unlike Havana, and that XXXXXXXXXXX take tremendous pride in 
their city.  He added that they are loath to criticize Fidel 
Castro for the GOC's shortcomings, choosing instead to vilify 
local leaders, including the First Secretary of Santiago's 
Communist Party office.  XXXXXXXXXXX then criticized Castro as 
"mono-thematic," saying he is unable to focus on more than 
one thing at a time.  He added that from 8 pm to 3 am each 
day, Castro reviews the latest reports on State Security 
operations, in an effort "to continue the control, the 
blackmailing."  On the Cuban Foreign Ministry's reported 
assignment of Gustavo Machin, head of the North American 
bureau, to an ambassadorial post in Pakistan, the COM said 
the move appeared to be a demotion.  XXXXXXXXXXX agreed that at 
worst, it is a demotion, but at best, it is an opportunity 
for Machin to focus on examining U.S. intelligence efforts in 
Pakistan. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶5. (S) It's unclear what prompted XXXXXXXXXXX to 
 
HAVANA 00009102  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
criticize the Internet-access policy of USINT, historically 
their strongest and most important ally.  They could be 
acting out of principle, trying to win favor with other 
dissidents, attempting to burnish their own credentials - or 
all three.  Either way, we found it unpalatable that at a 
time when very few Cubans enjoy Internet access and one 
activist is starving himself to make that point, key 
dissidents would fault USINT for acting to ensure that the 
Centers function fairly for all approved users.  It should 
also be noted that the credibility of both Sanchez and Roca 
has long been a matter of speculation.  Sanchez was at one 
point undeniably linked to State Security, and similar 
accusations have long surrounded Roca.  Roca's past as a GOC 
insider lends credence to his astute observation that Machin 
may have been sent to Pakistan to develop spy networks. 
Regarding Roca's assertion that Fidel is "mono-thematic," we 
acknowledge that the dictator can be seized by a single 
issue.  However (reftel), he has managed to juggle a number 
of issues this year, including energy revolution, moves 
against corruption, and the GOC's propaganda response to U.S. 
"terrorism."
