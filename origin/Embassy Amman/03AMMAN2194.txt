SUBJECT: UN FLASH APPEAL FOR HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE IN IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 89192 
 
¶1.  (U) As requested ref, refcoord contacted UN Resident 
Coordinator Christine McNab to ensure that UN officials in 
Jordan have raised the UN flash appeal with GOJ officials. 
McNab said that UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq Ramiro 
Lopes da Silva will be in Jordan April 11-13 and will brief 
senior GOJ officials on the appeal at that time. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Although King Abdullah on April 9 directed the GOJ 
"to take all necessary measures to launch a national campaign 
to extend humanitarian aid and secure essential medical and 
food supplies for the Iraqi people," we do not anticipate 
that this campaign will include a contribution to the UN 
flash appeal.  Instead, the GOJ is likely to contribute 
in-kind medical and technical assistance.  The Foreign 
Minister and Minister of Planning will launch the campaign 
later today (April 10); we will report GOJ plans septel.
