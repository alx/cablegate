SUBJECT:  PLACEMENT OF PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY HIV/AIDS 
INITIATIVE 
 
REF:  STATE 142342 
 
¶1. Reftel requested posts to use IIP materials to publicize 
the president's new HIV/AIDS initiative. 
 
¶2. Colombo used two IIP products to splash the rollout 
across the Sri Lankan press. 
 
- News File.  During noon and evening newscasts "News File" 
clips describing the initiative were used by MTV 
(independent English telecaster) and its Sinhala- and 
Tamil-medium affiliates, as well as by SWARNAVAHINI 
(independent Sinhala telecaster). 
 
- Washington file.  The May 27 Washington File piece, "Bush 
Signs Initiative to Fight AIDS Abroad," was placed in the 
DAILY NEWS (government-owned English daily), the ISLAND 
(independent English daily), and THINAKARAN (government- 
owned Tamil daily). 
 
¶3. We await receipt of the generic op-eds described in 
reftel, and will use them as appropriate in the Sri Lankan 
context.
