REASON: 1.4 (b), (c), (d)



¶1. (S/NF) Summary: xxxxx based in Tehran, in
separate conversations with IRPO officers, said that officials
in Iran's Ministry of Interior are willing to work with the
United States on issues relating to Afghanistan within a United
Nations framework. Specifically, they noted that the IRIG is
seeking cooperation and assistance to address the problems of
refugees/economic migrants from Afghanistan and combating the
flow of narcotics from Afghanistan. Both men pointed to xxxxx as the likely IRIG lead on any
such initiative. End summary.

Refugees and Counter Narcotics: Potential Areas for Technical
Cooperation

¶2. (S/NF) During a November xxxxx
described counter-narcotics and refugees as areas ripe for
cooperation between Iran and the United States. xxxxx
there is strong support within the Ministry of Interior for a
joint and pragmatic approach to address problems emanating from
Afghanistan. xxxxx argued that elements within the IRIG,
particularly at the sub-ministerial and working levels, would be
comfortable working with the USG under the UN umbrella. In a
separate conversation, xxxxx said that Iranian officials have repeatedly
expressed interest to UNODC staff in Iran about working
multilaterally, including with the US and the UK, to combat the
production of drugs in Afghanistan as well as drug trafficking
to/through Iran.

¶3. (S/NF) xxxxx said that any contribution on the part of the
United States toward easing the societal and economic burdens
the instability in Afghanistan places on Iran would be well
received by both the people and the government of Iran.
Iranians, in his estimation, feel that their assistance to
Afghan refugees over the decades of war in that country has been
unappreciated by the international community in general and the
US in particular. xxxxx also argued that explicit and
tangible contributions to refugee assistance, above and beyond
our contributions to UNHCR, would help undermine IRIG officials'
attempts to portray USG actions in the region as inhumane.
xxxxx cited increasing negative domestic press coverage of the
effects on Iran caused by the "reverse flow" of economic
migrants from Afghanistan to Iran. At the same time, xxxxx
cautioned against the USG publicly trying to take credit for its
assistance, as publicity could backfire by causing MOI officials
to back away.

¶4. (S/NF) Both xxxxx as a potential interlocutor for both counter-narcotics
and refugee issues. xxxxx is xxxxx able to "get many things
done." xxxxx is known as a pragmatist rather
than an ideologue and has a solid working relationship with the
xxxxx in Iran.

¶5. (S/NF) xxxxx believes that just within the past couple of
months, members of Tehran's political elite who favor
cooperation with the West on Afghanistan have become noticeably
emboldened. xxxxx. While acknowledging that
invitation-only discussions held in think tanks and research
centers affiliated with state institutions hardly signals a sea
change in official thinking, xxxxx argued forcefully that just
a few months ago such events would have been unthinkable.

¶6. (S/NF) In a separate discussion with xxxxx in early November, IRPO first heard that the Iranian

government - in this case xxxxx
- was keenly interested in counternarcotics cooperation with the
US. Following up above via two separate UN agency officials
based in Iran, we are now confident that this interest is
genuine, although we can not ascribe IRIG motivations.
