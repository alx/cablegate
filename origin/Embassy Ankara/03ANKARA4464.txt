SUBJECT: IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL: TURKS UNHAPPY WITH 
TURKMEN REPRESENTATION 
 
REF: STATE 202537 
 
 
(U) Classified by DCM Robert Deutsch, reasons 1.5, b/d. 
 
 
¶1. (U) Baghdad minimize considered. 
 
 
¶2. (S) After several unsuccessful attempts to schedule a 
joint US/UK meeting to deliver reftel points to MFA's Iraq 
department at the working level, UK Ambassador Westmacott 
reportedly raised the points with MFA U/S Ziyal and DG 
Burcuoglu July 15 during a previously scheduled meeting.  The 
UK Ambassador described the discussion as "extremely 
unrewarding" in that he received a long tirade from Ziyal and 
Burcuoglu about the Turkmen situation in Iraq in general. 
Westmacott tried to emphasize the positive aspects of the 
GC's composition, including the fact that the Turkmen 
representative was an Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF) member and 
the sole representative from Kirkuk.  When the Turks noted 
peevishly that she was not on the leadership council of the 
ITF, Westmacott reportedly retorted that, were there any 
"constructive" candidates on ITF's leadership council, they 
might have been considered.  After some prodding, the Turks 
said they might consider issuing a statement supportive of 
the GC, but would possibly include that they had concerns 
about the composition of the council.  DCM also raised the 
issue of the Council with Burcuoglu at a luncheon July 15. 
Burcuoglu similarly objected to the number of Turkmen as well 
as the absence of clear ITF leadership.  He said the MFA was 
meeting later that day to decide how to react to the Council. 
 
 
¶3. (S) Comment: The UK Embassy assessed that the Turks are 
still smarting far too much from the July 4 incident to have 
a productive dialogue on this topic now.  The points have 
been raised, and we agree it would be best to let this topic 
rest until some of the emotion fades.
