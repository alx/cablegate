TO AROUND 5 PERCENT OF GNP (IMF RESREP SAYS LESS

¶2. (U) ON JANUARY 28, DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER 
ABDULLATIF SENER (IN CHARGE OF ECONOMIC POLICY 
COORDINATION) GAVE PRESS REMARKS FOLLOWING A 
MEETING OF THE HIGHER PLANNING COUNCIL (CHAIRED

AND KEY ECONOMIC AGENCY HEADS).  SENER 
REITERATED THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT'S INTENTION TO 
MEET AND EVEN EXCEED THE PRIMARY SURPLUS TARGET 
OF 6.5 PERCENT OF THE GNP.  HE SAID THE 2003 
BUDGET WOULD ACTUALLY RESULT IN A HIGHER, 6.8 
PERCENT PRIMARY SURPLUS, BUT HE DIDN'T UNVEIL 
THE FISCAL SAVING MEASURES THAT WOULD LEAD TO 
THIS TARGET.  HE DID NOTE THAT THE 2003 BUDGET 
WOULD ELMINATE SOME 600 PROJECTS FROM THE PUBLIC 
INVESTMENT PROGRAM (THESE ARE LARGELY PROJECTS 
THAT HAD RECEIVED SOME PRELIMINARY APPROVALS BUT 
HAD NOT BEEN FUNDED AT ANY LEVEL IN PRIOR 
BUDGETS, I.E., HAD NO FEASIBILITY STUDIES.) 
 
 
¶3.  (U) ON JANUARY 29, THE HIGH PLANNING COUNCIL 
BEGAN MEETING AT 4:00 P.M. LOCAL TIME, WITH THE 
AGENDA OF ADOPTING THE FISCAL SAVING MEASURES 
REQUIRED TO REACH THE PRIMARY SURPLUS TARGET.

ANNOUNCEMENT, HIS OFFICE RELEASED THE 2003 MACRO- 
ECONOMIC TARGETS, AND THE FINANCE MINISTRY

AGGREGATES.  WE CONFIRMED THE FIGURES WITH 
FINANCE MINISTRY'S BUDGET DEPARTMENT HEAD AHMET

(NOTE: SEES ARE STATE ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES. IN 
ADDITION TO THIS $1.1 BILLION BUDGET ALLOCATION 
TO THEM, SOME SEES MAKE GOOD PROFITS BASED ON 
STATE-CONTROLLED MONOPOLY POSITIONS OVER KEY 
BUSINESSES SUCH AS ALCOHOL IMPORTATION (TEKEL), 
OIL REFINING (TUPRAS), NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION 
(BOTAS).)

TL 19.7 QUADRILLION ($11.2 BILLION) OR 5.6 
PERCENT OF GNP. 
 
 
(NOTE: THIS IS A NARROWER DEFINITION OF PRIMARY 
SURPLUS WHICH INCLUDES ONLY THE CENTRAL 
GOVERNMENT.  THE IMF DEFINITION INCLUDES THE 
ENTIRE PUBLIC SECTOR, INCLUDING SEES, SOCIAL 
SECURITY AND OFF-BUDGET FUNDS, AND 
MUNICIPALITIES.   FOR MONITORING PURPOSES, THE 
IMF "PRIMARY SURPLUS" INCLUDES ONLY EIGHT 
SELECTED SEES AND CERTAIN OF THE FUNDS, BUT NOT 
ALL OF THEM, BECAUSE IT TAKES MONTHS TO GET THE 
ENTIRE PUBLIC SECTOR DATA.  WE STILL DON'T HAVE 
THE FINAL 2002 IMF ENTIRE PUBLIC SECTOR PRIMARY 
SURPLUS, THOUGH THE IMF ESTIMATES IT AT 4.4 
PERCENT OF GNP.) 
 
 
COMMENT:  HEALTHY SKEPTICISM

¶5.  (SBU) MARKETS ARE NOW WAITING FOR NEWS OF 
THE FISCAL MEASURES NEEDED TO MEET THE 6.5 
PERCENT OF GNP PRIMARY SURPLUS.  TREASURY DEPUTY

HIGHER PLANNING COUNCIL WILL REACH CONSENSUS ON 
THE MEASURES (WHICH INVOLVE CUTS IN REAL TERMS 
TO CIVIL SERVANT WAGES, CUTTING BACK THE 
PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFIT TO SOCIAL SECURITY, AND 
OTHER POLITICALLY DIFFICULT ITEMS). 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) FINANCE MINISTRY BUDGET DEPARTMENT 
HEAD AHMET KESIK TOLD US IN PRIVATE HE'S 
SKEPTICAL THAT THE NEW SET OF MEASURES WILL ADD 
TO 6.5 PERCENT.   KESIK SAYS THE MEASURES HE'S 
SEEN ADD UP TO ABOUT 5 PERCENT (AND IMF RESREP 
TOLD US THE IMF ESTIMATE IS LOWER THAN 5 
PERCENT.   AS FOR THE 6.8 PERCENT TARGET 
ANNOUNCED BY SENER, KESIK SAID IT'S A PUBLIC 
RELATIONS PLOY - HE SEEMS TO HAVE PULLED IT OUT 
OF THE AIR.
