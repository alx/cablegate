REF: STATE 235543 
 
 
Turkish MFA NATO Head of Department Bulent Meric told 
PolMilOff August 15 that the seven bills to approve the 
Accession Protocols for the new NATO members have been 
approved in committee and are now before the full Parliament. 
 As a "priority" item, the bills should be considered 
immediately upon resumption of Parliament October 1.  If 
approved, they would then have to be signed by the President 
before being published in the Gazette.  Then the instruments 
of ratification would be submitted to the State Department. 
However, because the bills are "priority," if the GOT calls 
an extraordinary session of Parliament in September, the 
bills would have to be considered during the extraordinary 
session and cannot be deferred until October 1.  In any case, 
Meric believed the instruments of ratification would be 
deposited by the end of October.  Embassy will report on any 
developments in this area.
