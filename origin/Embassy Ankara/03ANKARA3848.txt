Lifting Sanctions on Imports from Iraq 
-------------------------------------- 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Unakitan told the Ambassador that he had met with 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the State Minister for 
Foreign Trade, and the Interior Minister on June 11 at the 
direction of the Prime Minister to resolve problems at the 
Habur Gate.  Unakitan stated that the barter of gasoline and 
liquid petroleum gas for Iraqi crude oil would go forward, 
and that MFA would send a letter to Foreign Trade to enable 
Delta Petroleum to begin implementing the barter arrangement. 
 Unakitan in fact invited the Delta Petroleum General 
Director to attend part of the meeting with the Ambassador, 
and suggested that Delta follow up with MFA and the Foreign 
Trade U/S.  Unakitan raised the issue of KDP levies on 
Turkish trucks entering Iraq.  The Ambassador responded that 
the KDP had recently cut its fees to USD 20 per truck, based 
on information we had received (but not confirmed). 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Turkmen told Econoff that MFA had sent a letter to 
the Prime Ministry June 13 requesting issuance of 
instructions to all relevant GOT bodies to open the Habur 
border crossing to Iraqi imports.  Turkmen believes this will 
be implemented sometime during the week of June 16.  With 
regard to the Delta import/export arrangement, Turkmen 
confirmed that MFA sent a letter to U/S Foreign Trade 
requesting specific authorization for the fuel import/export 
with Iraq to begin immediately. 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) Mengu confirmed that Foreign Trade had received 
MFA,s letter on Delta, but insisted that there would be no 
special deal for Delta.  Mengu maintained that Delta would be 
able to implement its barter arrangement when Turkey lifted 
remaining sanctions on Iraqi imports.  He predicted that this 
would happen within several days.  Mengu also raised the 
issue of KDP taxation of Turkish trucks, but stated that 
Turkey,s opening to Iraqi imports was not linked to an end 
to KDP fee collection.  Econoff responded that coalition 
authorities were working toward elimination of customs fees 
at all of Iraq,s border crossings.

as soon as possible, and requested U.S. cooperation in this 
matter.  The Ambassador responded that the Embassy would 
follow up on this issue.  Note:  See ref B on establishing 
civilian air control between Iraq and Turkey.  End Note.
