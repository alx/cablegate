¶1. (SBU) Topa Bilgetin Toker was reinstated on April 1 as 
Director General of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation 
(DGCA), replacing Serdar Cebeci.  Toker, who was discharged 
for unspecified reasons in August 2002, had filed a lawsuit 
against the state.  The court recently determined that Toker 
had been fired without cause, and therefore reinstated him as 
Director General.  Sources at the DGCA told us the 
reinstatement of Toker had been a legal decision, and had 
nothing to do with the AK Party Government.  One DGCA source 
said AK was not likely to replace Toker any time soon, given 
Toker,s successful lawsuit. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  We do not anticipate that this change will 
affect Turkey,s aviation policy.  Like Cebeci, Toker is an 
approachable contact.  End comment.
