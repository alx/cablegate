1,200 US soldiers are already deployed, intensive

cities. KDP's spokesman, Hasyar Zebari, announced 
that they were expecting thousands of US soldiers 
in northern Iraq in a very short time. The US

Turkey's not penetrating into northern Iraq in 
the absence of solid reasons. The US guaranteed

Halilzad said Turkey's penetration into northern 
Iraq should not be an objective for Turkey and 
the US would do its best to allay Turkey's 
concerns.
