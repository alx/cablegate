Hurriyet: Having obtain only over-flight 
permission from Turkey, the US is getting ready 
to close down its military bases in southeastern 
Turkey. Trucks and buses were dispatched to 
remove military personnel and equipment from 
Nusaybin's Industrial Zone. Vice Chairman for 
Nusaybin's Craftsmen and Merchants Association, 
Zeynel Tuncalan, said the industrial zone had 
been rented to the US in February for a period of 
one year at USD 248,000 a month; they did not 
receive any notification about the evacuation of 
the facilities. Some 1,800 military vehicles and 
500 containers of military equipment that were 
offloaded at Iskenderun port for the northern 
front will now be reloaded. No materiel has been 
dispatched from the port by rail for the past 
three days. Activity was seen at the air bases. A 
big number of C-17 cargo planes landed at Batman 
airport. 
 
 
¶3.  Cumhuriyet: Citizens in the Southeast 
complained about a lack of measures taken against 
the possible use of chemical and biological 
weapons. The inhabitants of Batman said it was 
mandatory during 1991 Gulf War for pharmacies to 
have atropine sulfate, an anti-poison drug, but 
now it was not available at any of the 50 
pharmacies in town. The citizens complained that 
neither the Provincial Health Directorate nor the 
Provincial Civil Defense Directorate had taken 
any measures, and that they needed at least 
500,000 atropine sulfate units. The Provincial 
Health Directorate officials said they were 
called at least by 50 or 70 people a day asking 
about precautions they should take in case of a 
chemical or biological attack.

unidentified country landed one kilometer away 
from Ozveren village in Sanliurfa province.  The 
debris left a four-meter-wide and one-meter-deep 
hole in the ground. The governor said Turkish 
military officials were examining the site. The 
jandarma found a 1.3 meter long metal piece near 
Ayakli village of Viransehir. It is reported that 
the metal piece found was a from a "guided 
missile," the body of which had exploded and 
fallen over a 500 meter area.
