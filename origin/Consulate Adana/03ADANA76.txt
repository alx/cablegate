t/Sabah/Turkiye: Charged with having provided 
assistance and support to the PKK and being a 
center for actions undertaken in contradiction to 
"the indivisibility of the state", the political 
party HADEP was ordered definitively closed by a 
unanimous vote by the Constitutional Court good 
per articles 68 and 69 of the Constitution under 
articles 101 and 103 of the Political Parties 
Law. HADEP's property will be turned over to the

at the Constitutional Court against DEHAP, 
founded as the substitute for HADEP, and demanded 
DEHAP's closure for good. 
 
 
Hurriyet: Turkey gave support to clearing of land 
mines, which killed 668 citizens during intensive 
PKK terrorism. According to the proposal, Turkey 
will clear all these land mines in 7 years. CHP 
deputy, Onur Oymen, pointed that despite the 
halting of PKK terror, some 16 persons, including 
children, were killed by land mines in 2001. 
Oymen said dismantling of the land mines would 
cost Turkey USD 300-400 million.

Commander, Gen. Michael Dotson, who was 
accompanied by high ranking American officials 
from Incirlik AB, met with Lt. Gen. Yalcin

Command in Iskenderun. After the talks at the 
Navy Command, Gen. Dotson visited the Iskenderun 
port and was briefed about the military 
shipments. After Gen. Dotson's visit to 
Iskenderun, the Turkish Land Forces Commander, 
Gen. Aytac Yalman, also inspected Turkish 
military units in Adana and Iskenderun. Gen. 
Yalman said the Turkish units were in excellent 
condition and were ready to fulfill any mission 
the Turkish people would give them. 
 
 
Radikal: In order to rescue the historical 
monuments in the Southeast from becoming a target 
in a war on Iraq, the Cultural Ministry will hang 
white and blue posters on them. The posters will 
be visible to pilots.  It is reported that 
objects in regional museums will be transferred 
to Kayseri when the war breaks out.  According to 
Hurriyet, Mardin's Provincial Director of 
Culture, Mustafa Kemal, said  warning flags would 
be hoisted at the Mardin museum, the Deyrul 
Zafaran Monastery, the Mardin castle, the Grand 
Mosque, the Kasimiye Medrese, and the Kirklar

and adjourned the hearing until May 14.
