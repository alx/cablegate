Governor of Adana, Kemal Onal, said the 
government had built houses for the earthquake 
victims in Adana in 1994. Governor Onal said two 
thousand families persisted living in the damaged 
and inhabitable houses rather than moving to the 
government-built houses. The governor added that 
those families would forcibly be evacuated by the 
security forces from those unsafe houses. 
 
 
¶5.  Milliyet: Because of the authority vested in 
the OHAL Governor (State of Extraordinary Rule 
Governor), the administrative decisions made by 
his office could not be reversed. Such a 
prevention in the provinces under the OHAL  has 
been found to be against the law. The OHAL 
Governor wanted to transfer a teacher in 
Diyarbakir for his activities. The teacher filed 
a petition with the Administrative Court for the 
reversal of the action, but the court dismissed 
the case. The teacher appealed the case to the 
Supreme Court which demanded the reversal of the 
action and submitted the file to the 
Constitutional Court. While five members of the 
Constitutional Court decided against the 
reversal, 6 decided in favor of the decision.

to cancel its contracts in Turkey, the owner of

protest the decision. Yuksel said he  had spent 
USD 450 thousand for the McDonalds, and had 
signed a contract for 20 years. Yuksel claimed 
that McDonalds' unilateral decision caused 19 of 
42 McDonalds outlet owners in Turkey to go 
bankrupt. Yuksel said, on a monthly basis, he 
paid 18 percent of his gross for rent, 5 percent 
for advertisement, and 5 percent for use of the 
brand name in addition to $45 thousand he had 
initially paid for franchising. Yuksel said he 
was offered only $75 thousand for closing down
