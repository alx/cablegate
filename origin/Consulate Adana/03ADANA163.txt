¶6.  Cumhuriyet: The road to Yesilgoz village of 
Beytussebap (Sirnak)is still closed. The 
villagers who are unable to return to their 
village have been trapped in Beytussebap for over 
a month. They are living in tents provided by 
Beytussebap's Red Crescent office. Non- 
governmental Organizations offered to contribute 
to the costs for opening Yesilgoz' forty 
kilometer-long village road. A Human Rights 
Association (HRA) delegation visited one hundred 
forty families living in tents, and prepared an 
observation report. At a press announcement in 
HRA's Diyarbakir chapter yesterday, the HRA's 
General Secretary, Feray Salman, said three 
hundred of seven hundred seventy five persons 
living in the tents were under twelve, and eighty 
percent of the campers were unable to buy basic 
needs, even bread. Feray said the number of 
people living in the tents would soon reach one 
thousand five hundred people as the schools would 
be closed for summer vacation. 
 
 
¶7.  Radikal/Hurriyet/Milli Gazete: Habur Border 
Gate, which was unilaterally closed down for two 
days by IKDP's forces in Northern Iraq, was 
reopened. While the US and UN's humanitarian 
relief trucks were permitted to cross the border, 
commercial trucks, which were not allowed to 
pass, formed a ten kilometer-long queue. Truckers 
carrying perishables got furious, and questioned 
who would be held responsible for the foodstuffs 
that went bad. Hurriyet reported six hundred 
trucks daily were carrying diesel from Northern 
Iraq to Turkey.
