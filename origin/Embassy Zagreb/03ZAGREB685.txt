REF: ZAGREB 669 
 
    ¶1.  ON MARCH 26, CROATIA'S PARLIAMENT DEBATED THE GOC 
POSITION ON IRAQ.  DEBATE WAS LIMITED BY A STRUCTURE AGREED 
IN ADVANCE BY PARLIAMENT LEADERS ON MARCH 21.  AT THE 
BEGINNING OF "QUESTION TIME," PM RACAN DELIVERED A BRIEF 
REPORT; PARTY LEADERS THEN HAD FIVE MINUTES EACH TO RESPOND. 
PM RACAN'S "REPORT" TRACKED CLOSELY WITH THE POSITION HE 
RELAYED PRIVATELY TO THE AMBASSADOR IN THEIR MARCH 24 MEETING 
(REFTEL).  RACAN REPEATED HIS EXPRESSION OF "REGRET" AT THE 
LACK OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY UNITY OVER IRAQ.  HE PUBLICLY 
ANNOUNCED HIS GOVERNMENT'S READINESS TO SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORTS IN HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, PEACEKEEPING AND POST-WAR 
RENEWAL OF IRAQ.  RACAN CALLED FOR A "REVITALIZATION" OF UN 
AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL BODIES AND SAID THAT THE UN SHOULD 
HAVE THE LEAD IN REBUILDING IRAQ. 
 
¶2.  LEADERS OF COALITION PARTIES GENERALLY BACKED THE GOC. 
VESNA PUSIC (HNS) SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE PLEASED WITH 
DEVELOPING AND THEN STICKING TO A CONSISTENT POSITION. 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE USG HAVE BEEN EXAGGERATED; THE ONLY 
IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE WAS CROATIA'S DECISION NOT TO BE LISTED 
AS A MEMBER OF THE COALITION SUPPORTING MILITARY ACTION IN 
IRAQ.  JOZO RADOS (LIBRA) SAID THAT THE LOCAL MEDIA HAS 
EXAGGERATED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGREED GOC LINE AND 
PRESIDENT MESIC'S SPEECH.  ZLATKO KRAMARIC (LS) SAID 
CROATIA'S POSITIONS ON THE EU AND THE U.S. MUST BE REDEFINED, 
HOPED THAT THE U.N WOULD NOT REGRESS TO THE LEAGUE OF 
NATIONS, AND HOPED THAT TERRORISM WOULD NOT SPILL OVER TO 
"OUR REGION."  LUKA TRCONIC (HSS) EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT 
DAMAGE DONE TO THE UN, ON WHICH "SMALL NATIONS LIKE CROATIA" 
RELY. 
 
    ¶3.  THE OPPOSITION REACTION TO THE PM'S REPORT WAS MIXED. 
THE HDZ -- THE ONLY PARTY TO PUBLICLY SUPPORT THE USE OF 
FORCE TO DISARM IRAQ -- DID NOT USE THEIR RIGHT OF REPLY. 
HDZ WHIP VLADIMIR SEKS SAID HIS PARTY HAD "PUBLICLY SHARED 
ITS VIEWS ON THE IRAQI CRISIS AND HAD NOTHING TO ADD TO ITS 
POSITIONS."  DC PRESIDENT MATE GRANIC CRITICIZED A LACK OF 
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT MESIC ON 
IRAQ, WONDERING WHY THE (STILL NOT ESTABLISHED) NATIONAL 
SECURITY COUNCIL HAD NOT BEEN USED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. 
GRANIC COMMENDED THE HIGH LEVEL OF UNITY THAT THE GOVERNMENT 
AND MOST POLITICAL PARTIES REACHED ON THE NEED OF UNSC 
APPROVAL OF THE MILITARY ACTION.  IDS LEADER DAMIR KAJIN 
ACCUSED PRESIDENT BUSH OF "LOSING TOUCH WITH REALITY" AND 
STARTING A "UNILATERAL" ACTION THAT WILL PRODUCE MORE 
ANTI-AMERICANISM. 
 
¶4.  DRAZEN BUDISA (HSLS) SAID THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD 
RECONSIDER ITS FOREIGN POLICY GOALS IN THE LIGHT OF NEW 
DIVISIONS.  RESPONDING TO RACAN'S DECLARATION THAT CROATIA 
WOULD SEEK TO PARTICIPATE IN POST-CONFLICT ACTIVITIES, BUDISA 
SAID THAT "CROATIA SHOULD NOT BE JOINING THE COUNTRIES WHICH 
WILL REBUILD IRAQ, BUT THOSE THAT ARE TRYING TO STOP THE 
WAR."  THE ONLY FIREWORKS OF THE "QUESTION TIME" SESSION WERE 
PROVIDED BY THE HDZ RIGHT-WING EXTREMIST LJUBO CESIC ROJS, 
WHO ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS NOISILY INTERJECTED HIS 
READINESS TO JOIN THE US-LED MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ.
