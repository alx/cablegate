SUBJECT: ISRAEL MEDIA REACTION

SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
Mideast 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media (lead story in Ha'aretz) quoted President Bush as saying 
yesterday that the recent disclosure of details on Israel's strike 
last September against a nuclear facility in Syria was meant to 
pressure North Korea and send a strong message to Tehran.  Israel 
Radio reported that yesterday the members of the quarterly 
Israeli-American strategic dialogue expressed their belief that 
current sanctions against Iran are having economic effects, but so 
far have been ineffective in halting Iran's nuclear program.  Citing 
Reuters, Ha'aretz quoted World Jewish Congress officials, who met 
with Swiss President Pascal Couchepin yesterday, as saying that they 
would urge the Swiss government to rethink a major deal to buy 
natural gas from Iran. 
 
Ha'aretz reported that Bush sought to project optimism towards the 
prospect of an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord this year and 
accused Hamas of trying to undermine peace efforts, while avoiding 
direct criticism of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter meetings with 
the group.  The Internet site Ynet reported yesterday that a recent 
meeting between the lead negotiations -- Tzipi Livni and Ahmed Qurei 
-- ended badly after Livni presented a proposal laying out future 
borders with Israel retaining control over Jerusalem, the Jordan 
Valley and larger settlement blocks in the West Bank.  Reportedly, 
Qurei reacted angrily by grabbing the map and pushing it away with 
both hands.  Livni's office refused to comment on the incident 
saying that the negotiations are not being conducted in public, 
while a senior Palestinian source confirmed the details.  Another 
Israeli source quoted in the story said that this just clarifies how 
far away the sides are from an agreement.  This morning Israeli 
Radio reported that in an interview with the Palestinian daily 
Al-Ayyam U.S. Consul-General in Jerusalem Jacob Walles criticized 
Israeli settlement and roadblock policy, and hinted that the 
settlement blocs, for which former prime minister Ariel Sharon 
allegedly obtained from President Bush on April 14, 2004,a U.S. 
Letter of Assurances okaying their future annexation to Israel, are 
negotiable. 
 
 
Ha'aretz reported that Israel relayed a message this week to Egypt 
that it objected to the outlines of the cease-fire now under 
discussion for Gaza, since it might lead to the strengthening of 
Hamas and the weakening of PA President Mahmoud Abbas.  Ha'aretz 
quoted a GOI source in Jerusalem as saying that at this time it 
appears that there has been no significant progress in talks between 
Egypt and the Palestinian factions.  Israel Radio reported that the 
PFLP and Islamic Jihad have voiced reservations about Hamas's terms 
for a cease-fire.  All media reported that yesterday IDF 
Intelligence head Maj. Gen. Amos Yadlin told the cabinet that Hamas 
will do everything it can to spoil Israel's 60th birthday bash next 
week with a high-profile terrorist attack.  Israel Radio reported 
that yesterday Secretary Rice told an American Jewish Committee 
audience that Hamas, which she said "is increasingly serving as 
proxy warriors for Iran," must be isolated.  The Jerusalem Post 
quoted senior Hamas officials Mahmoud Zahar as saying yesterday that 
Israel may have 200 nuclear warheads, but that Hamas has 200,000 
people who want to blow themselves up inside Israel.  Ha'aretz and 
other media reported that Israel-Egypt relations have recently 
warmed up following the border breach by Hamas. 
 
Maariv reported that what jump-started the recent flurry of activity 
on the Syrian negotiating track was a phone call by PM Ehud Olmert 
to Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in which he allegedly said that 
he is aware of the "deposit" (left by the late PM Yitzhak Rabin). 
 
Leading media cited the IDF's insistence that the Gaza mother and 
her four children killed on Monday were struck by militants' 
explosives, not a shell.  Ha'aretz reported that the IDF probe will 
be presented this evening to the army brass.  The newspaper cited 
admission by military sources that the evidence available is 
limited. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that the possibility of holding an 
international conference in Moscow sometime in June is expected to 
be one of the main issues the Quartet will discuss in London on 
Friday, with Israel under the impression that the Kremlin is intent 
on going ahead with it. 
 
Ha'aretz and Israel Radio cited a joint Israeli-Palestinian report 
recently submitted to security authorities, according to which 10 
roadblocks that Israel set up in the West Bank have little security 
value and are needlessly disrupting trade in the Palestinian 
territories.  The report, drawn up by a team that included U.S. 
experts, Palestinian officials, and former IDF officers working 
under the auspices of the Peres Center for Peace, the Palestine 
 
Center for National Strategic Studies, and the Danish government, 
urges Israel to remove the roadblocks. 
 
Over the past few days media reported that the Muslim hackers' group 
DZ Team (comprising Algerians and Egyptians) broke into the Bank of 
Israel's Internet site and threatened to attack other Israeli 
sites. 
 
Yediot reported that while Jordan is preserving and maintaining the 
resources of the Dead Sea's Eastern bank, Israel is not doing 
anything on its side. 
 
Ha'aretz quoted Yoel Lifschitz, the Deputy Director General of the 
Health Ministry, as saying that Israel has been kept on the USTR's 
priority watch list of countries accused of intellectual property 
rights (IPR) violations because the Industry and Trade Ministry hid 
key information from the health and justice ministries. 
 
All media highlighted Holocaust Memorial Day-related events.  The 
commemoration will last from this evening through tomorrow night. 
The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday the U.S. military attache 
in Israel was on an IDF-guided tour of the Yad Mordechai Holocaust 
Museum for foreign military officers. 
 
Major media reported that the Forbes business magazine has rated 
Israel as the world's most "up-and-coming" real estate market.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Columnist Calev Ben-David wrote in the conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post: "The only answer [to the Hamas offensive in Gaza] is 
a sustained public diplomacy effort to demonstrate what the results 
would be if the IDF didn't act against Hamas." 
 
Uri Elitzur, who was a senior aide top former prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu, wrote in the editorial of the nationalist, 
Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe (4/30): "Israel shouldn't apologize 
for the deaths of the mother and her four children in Beit Hanun.... 
The Palestinians have no one to blame but themselves." 
 
The ultra-Orthodox Hamodi'a editorialized: "Syrian President Assad 
... isn't on his own.  He can't free himself from the axis of 
evil." 
 
Conservative columnist Yosef Harif wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv: "[Syria] can only achieve [progress] through U.S. and 
Western assistance.... [Israel] can certainly not make an early 
declaration about a withdrawal." 
 
Jewish affairs reporter Yair Sheleg wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz: "The European sin is not anti-Semitism but 
rather pacifism, especially when dealing with the Europeans' 
attitude toward force on the part of a Western country.  But this is 
not a sin that is any less dangerous than anti-Semitism." 
 
Block Quotes: 
------------- 
 
¶I.  "Making the Best of a No-Win Situation" 
 
Columnist Calev Ben-David wrote in the conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post (4/30): "The phrase 'damned if we do, damned if we 
don't' is an apt description of Israel's overall situation in Gaza 
as it confronts an enemy that doesn't hesitate to sue the hapless 
civilians of Beit Hanun as cover for its Qassam and sniper fire.  At 
the end of the day -- or any specific day, to be more precise -- 
there's nothing Israel's oft-criticized hasbara [public relations] 
efforts can do to completely assuage the impact of images like those 
out of Beit Hanun on Monday.  The only answer is a sustained public 
diplomacy effort to demonstrate what the results would be if the IDF 
didn't act against Hamas -- namely, an even greater increase in the 
attacks against Israeli civilians in Sderot and other communities 
along the Gaza border." 
 
II.  "Don't Apologize" 
 
Uri Elitzur, who was a senior aide top former prime minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu, wrote in the editorial of the nationalist, 
Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe (4/30): "Israel shouldn't apologize 
for the deaths of the mother and her four children in Beit Hanun.... 
The Palestinians have no one to blame but themselves.  They started 
this war; they're the only ones who can stop it; every day they 
again choose not to do so.  Neither should Israel invest enormous 
resources to court the world media to prove its claim that the 
killing was caused by Palestinian explosives and not by IDF fire. 
That Sisyphean PR effort would do more harm than good.... All Israel 
can say is that such things happen in war and that they will 
unfortunately occur in the future, too, if the Palestinians do not 
decide to stop the terror and Qassam fire." 
 
III.  "Syria Has Capitulated to Iran" 
 
The ultra-Orthodox Hamodi'a editorialized (4/30): "It was to be 
expected that talk about a peace agreement with Syria would dissolve 
during its formative period.  Syrian President Assad ... isn't on 
his own.  He can't free himself from the axis of evil.... The 
Iranians panicked when the media blatantly publicized messages 
between Israel and Syria.  They were all the more terrified when 
Assad appointed an envoy to manage the talks via a Turkish 
representative .  When the Iranians panic, the Syrian President has 
hardly any choice but to give in.... At least as regards the 
prevention of scary and painful discord [in Israel], the Syrian 
President, who climbed down the tall tree that Olmert placed in 
front of him, deserves thanks." 
 
IV.  "No to Syria" 
 
Conservative columnist Yosef Harif wrote in the popular, pluralist 
Maariv (4/30): "Israel has a bitter experience with Syria.  Over 
recent years, when Damascus-Tehran ties became stronger and as Syria 
is flooding Hizbullah with weapons and rockets, it has turned into a 
dangerous enemy.  Syria aspires to stabilize its shaky economic 
conditions and enter a track of development and of scientific and 
technological progress.  It can only achieve these through U.S. and 
Western assistance.  It will be able to receive that aid only if it 
disengages from Iran, shake off Hizbullah, and cease to sponsor the 
terrorist organizations operating from its territory.  Negotiations 
can only develop if Syria does fulfill those conditions.  [Israel] 
can certainly not make an early declaration about a withdrawal. 
Some people fear that Olmert, who aspires to a diplomatic 
achievement for electoral reasons, will express his willingness for 
important concessions on the Golan before the issue is intensely 
discussed.  This is a risky gamble." 
 
¶V.  "No Less Dangerous than Anti-Semitism" 
 
Jewish affairs reporter Yair Sheleg wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (4/30): "Israel is not alone in facing the 
arrows of European criticism, but rather stands alongside the United 
States.  Uncle Sam is also constantly attacked by European public 
opinion for having aggressive policies; the clearest example of the 
past few years being, of course, the American invasion and control 
of Iraq.  And indeed there is a common denominator to the European 
criticism of Israel and the U.S., and this common denominator 
apparently also stems from the lessons of that war.  It is the 
phenomenon of European pacifism, the desire to avoid the use of any 
kind of force, to avoid any forceful confrontation even with evil 
regimes.  This instinct is particularly salient when talking about a 
confrontation of a Western country with a society from the 
developing world, such as the confrontation between the U.S. and 
Iraq or between Israel and the Palestinians.... Israel is indeed 
discriminated against by the criticism leveled at it; not 
necessarily because it is a Jewish state, but rather mainly because 
it is a Western state.  That is to say, the European sin is not 
anti-Semitism but rather pacifism, especially when dealing with the 
Europeans' attitude toward force on the part of a Western country. 
But this is not a sin that is any less dangerous than 
anti-Semitism."
