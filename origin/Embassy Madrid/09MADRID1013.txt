REF: STATE 106819 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY: Spain's Minister of Environment and Rural and Marine 
Affairs (MARM) will vote in favor of proposals to approve three 
biotech maize varieties for import at the October 19 Agriculture 
Council Meeting, although GOS officials do not expect the proposals 
to be approved.  While a delegate to the Standing Committee 
indicated that Spain's final decision on the MIR604 and Syngenta 
Bt11 is still being debated within Spain's Inter-Ministerial 
Council, a Ministry official assured AgCouns that Spain will also 
vote favorably on the two biotech maize proposals at the October 19 
Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  Econoff delivered reftel demarche October 15 to Alfredo Bonet, 
Secretary General for Trade at the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, 
and Trade.  Bonet replied that his Ministry favored approval of the 
biotech maize varieties and would advocate for this position in 
Spain's Inter-Ministerial Council, but he was not in a position to 
state what Spain's final position would be. 
 
¶3.  Separately, Agricultural Counselor and Agricultural Specialist 
met October 15 with Eduardo Diez Patier, Chief of Staff to the 
Secretary of State for Rural Affairs and Water, to deliver reftel 
demarche. 
 
¶4.  According to Diez Patier, both the Minister of Environment and 
Rural and Marine Affairs, Elena Espinosa, and the Secretary of State 
(Vice-Minister equivalent) for Rural Affairs and Water, Josef Puxeu, 
will attend the October 19 meeting of the Agriculture Council. 
Spain will vote in favor of all three biotech maize varieties for 
import.  However, he noted that they do not expect the vote to pass 
and so the issue will be deferred to the Commission.  The problem is 
that the current Commission, which meets every Wednesday, expires on 
October 31.  The Commission will have two opportunities to vote on 
the three biotech maize varieties before its term expires.  If there 
is no vote before November 1, then the issue will be deferred to the 
new Commission.  The Chief of Staff stated that this will be 
problematic as it may take some time for newly elected EU 
governments to select new Commission members.  The interim 
"temporary" Commission could take up the biotech maize issue - or it 
could be deferred until later in the year when all positions are 
permanently filled.  This could potentially delay the vote until 
January 2010 or later. 
 
¶5.  Mr. Diez Patier also confidently stated that Spain would vote in 
favor of both MIR604 maize for import and the renewal of approval 
for Syngenta Bt11 at the October 19 Standing Committee Meeting. 
However, a follow-up call to Esther Esteban, Area Manager at the 
General Directorate of Sustainable Development who coordinates 
biotech policy issues in Spain, indicated a less certain position. 
Ms. Esteban noted that Anabel de la Pena from the Spanish Agency for 
Food Safety and Nutrition and Jesus Salas from MARM's Sub 
Directorate for Animal Feed will attend the Standing Committee 
Meeting for Spain.  She stated that the Inter-Ministerial Council, 
which will decide on Spain's vote, is still deliberating and will 
meet on Friday afternoon to come to consensus on the two biotech 
maize votes. 
 
¶6.  COMMENT:  While the Inter-Ministerial Council appears to still 
be debating Spain's position on the two biotech maize approvals at 
the Standing Committee, the Chief of Staff clearly stated that the 
Government of Spain would not deviate from its traditional position 
of supporting new biotech approvals and renewals.  The anti-GMO 
factions within MARM's environmental departments are losing strength 
and influence as Ministry officials at the highest levels continue 
to push their pro-biotechnology position both at home and in 
Brussels.  END COMMENT.
