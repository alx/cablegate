EC to Limit FROB Funding of Distressed Banks 
 
¶1. (U) The European Commission will limit Spain's banking 
sector restructuring fund (FROB) to loans of no more than 2% 
of 'risk-weighted assets' to distressed banks and savings 
banks, or 2% of their "determined minimum amount of capital 
to operate effectively."  The EC made this announcement after 
the Spanish government said the FROB would be allowed to loan 
up to 2.5%.  The EC will make a final decision on approval 
before February 9.  The expected approval will allow the GOS 
the ability to use the FROB without case-by-case 
authorization from Brussels, ultimately speeding up the 
banking sector restructuring process. The FROB has 9 billion 
euros and the ability to borrow up to 10 times that amount, 
for a total of 99 billion euros available.  (El Pais, 1/19 
and 1/22) 
 
Competition Commission Accuses Copyright Management Entities 
of Monopolistic Practices 
 
¶2. (U) The National Competition Commission (CNC) issued a 
100-page report accusing Spain's copyright management 
entities (collecting societies) of monopolistic practices in 
representing the interests of artists and entertainers and 
collecting royalties.  In response, the largest and 
best-known of the management entities, the General Society of 
Authors and Publishers (SGAE), joined forces with three 
smaller groups to form a new group, 'Ibercrea' (Iberian 
Creators), to defend their interests collectively.  The CNC 
report represents a new conflict between the GOS and the 
members of Ibercrea, who support the government's 
controversial legislative proposal to combat internet piracy 
of copyrighted works.  Separately, two outspoken Spanish 
attorneys known for their support of free downloading, Javier 
de la Cueva and David Bravo, presented the report to the 
European Court of Justice, claiming that Spain is in 
violation of the EU's anti-trust laws by allowing the 
copyright entities to operate.  Comment: The management 
entities, especially SGAE, are unpopular in Spain due to 
their support for the "digital canon" private copy levy. 
SGAE in particular suffers from a bad public image resulting 
from its aggressive practices in collecting royalties.  The 
current anti-trust accusations, combined with demonstrations 
by employees over working conditions and pay, only add to 
SGAE's woes.  (El Pais, 1/21 and 1/22) 
 
Online Piracy Blamed for Drop in Music Sales 
 
¶3. (U) The International Federation of the Phonographic 
Industry (IFPI) recorded a worldwide drop of 30% in sales 
over the past five years, while Spanish artists have seen 
sales fall by 65%.  Overall sales in Spain fell 17% in the 
past year alone.  Industry representatives cited frustration 
over what they described as the GOS' passivity in fighting 
piracy.  However, the head of the IFPI's local branch, 
Promusicae, expressed hope that the GOS would "continue the 
process it has just started," referring to the controversial 
"anti-downloading" provisions in the government's draft 
Economic Sustainability Law.  (El Pais, 1/21)
