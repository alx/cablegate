  ¶1.   Under headline "Bush and Blair lied about Iraq" the 
      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its 
      June 8 editorial to criticizing the United States-led war 
      against Iraq, saying, "the invasion of Iraq was unjust." 
      Adding: "Bush and Blair are shameless liars."  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "Statements by a senior U. S. defense official that 
      Pentagon had `no reliable information' that Iraq had 
      chemical and biological weapons have clearly left both the 
      White House and Number 10 Downing Street with egg in the 
      face. . .After nearly two months in which British and U. S. 
      troops have occupied huge swaths of Iraq, detaining and 
      interrogating leading Ba'athist officials and scientists, 
      no trace has been found of any chemical and biological 
      weapons arsenal. . .Global opinion appears to be vindicated 
      in its criticism of the unjustified attack on Iraq.  As 
      Bush and Blair, along with the Australians, renew their 
      hunt for Iraq's elusive WMDs, the world remains firm in its 
      conviction that the invasion of Iraq was unjust and that 
      Bush and Blair are shameless liars."
