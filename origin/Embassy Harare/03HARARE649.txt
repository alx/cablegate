  ¶1.   Editorials in the March 30 edition of the 
      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday News" and its 
      sister daily "Chronicle" published on March 29 accused 
      the United States pursuing similar policies in Iraq 
      and Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   Under headline "We must reject violence" the 
      government-controlled weekly "The Sunday News" (03/30) 
      comments: 
 
      ". . .The ongoing invasion of Iraq by the U.S. 
      and Britain has reminded the world once again 
      that militarily superior countries will trample 
      on developing countries without so much of a 
      worry.  If the so-called Western coalition that 
      is sponsoring violence in Zimbabwe and also 
      waging war in Iraq really values democracy, 
      human rights and the rule of law, those 
      countries would not have declared war without 
      the authority of the U.N. Security 
      Council. . ." 
 
  ¶3.   Under headline "A case of double standards" the 
      government-controlled daily "Chronicle" (03/29) 
      comments: 
 
      ". . .We are not amused at the double standards 
      of the Americans who want to tell Zimbabwe how 
      to deal with those breaking the law.  America 
      should apply the same principles when dealing 
      with those demonstrating against the Iraqi war 
      or forever hold its peace.  We cannot allow the 
      kettle to call the pot black.  We urge the 
      American public to rise against the killing of 
      innocent civilians in Baghdad in the name of 
      civilization. . .  Somebody must stop this 
      lunatic called George Bush, lest the whole world 
      be held to ransom in his quest to boost his 
      ego."
