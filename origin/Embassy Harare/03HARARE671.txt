  ¶1.   Under headline "Maiming and killing of innocent 
      Iraqis disturbing" the government-controlled daily 
      "The Herald" (04/03) carried an op-ed by Synos 
      GodKnows Zhou (sic).  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .Saddam might be evil and all that, but for 
      anybody to go into Iraq and release heavy volleys of 
      missiles into buildings and into streets - hoping that 
      Saddam will be caught in the crossfire - is repugnant 
      madness and recklessness of the highest order. . .
