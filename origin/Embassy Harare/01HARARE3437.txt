SUBJECT: EMBASSY ANNOUNCES TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF PEACE 
CORPS PROGRAM IN ZIMBABWE 
 
 
¶1.   ON NOVEMBER 15, AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
   OF ZIMBABWE AND THE DELIVERY OF A DIPLOMATIC NOTE TO THE 
   MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, THE EMBASSY ANNOUNCED THE 
   TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE PEACE CORPS PROGRAM IN 
   ZIMBABWE.  FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF THAT ANNOUNCEMENT.  THE 
   LANGUAGE IN THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWED VERY CLOSELY 
   THAT OF THE DIPLOMATIC NOTE. 
 
¶2.   BEGIN TEXT OF PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT: FOLLOWING 
   CONSULTATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE, AND WITH 
   GREAT REGRET, THE U.S. EMBASSY ANNOUNCES THE TEMPORARY 
   SUSPENSION OF THE PEACE CORPS PROGRAM IN ZIMBABWE.  THE 
   EMBASSY REGRETS THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE'S FAILURE TO 
   PROVIDE WORK PERMITS FOR VOLUNTEER TEACHERS, AS STIPULATED 
   IN THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND THE 
   PEACE CORPS, FOLLOWING A THREE-MONTH TRAINING PERIOD IN 
   ZIMBABWE FOR THE VOLUNTEERS IN QUESTION.  BECAUSE OF THE 
   LONG LEAD-TIME NEEDED FOR SELECTION AND TRAINING OF 
   QUALIFIED VOLUNTEERS TO FILL THE SPECIALIZED POSITIONS, THE 
   EMBASSY REQUIRES ASSURANCES THAT THE TRAINEES SELECTED IN 
   CONSULTATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT 
   THEIR WORK. 
 
ABSENT SUCH ASSURANCES, THE EMBASSY BELIEVES IT IS PRUDENT 
TO TEMPORARILY SUSPEND PEACE CORPS OPERATIONS IN ZIMBABWE. 
THE EMBASSY AND THE PEACE CORPS HOPE TO CONSULT FURTHER 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AT A MUTUALLY AGREED FUTURE 
DATE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF RESUMING WHAT HAS BEEN A 
MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF 
ZIMBABWE AND THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.  END TEXT OF 
ANNOUNCEMENT.
