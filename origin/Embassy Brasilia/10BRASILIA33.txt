REF: 10 STATE 9124; STATE 120288 DERIVED FROM: Derived from previous message. 

¶1. (C) ChargC) delivered the reftel demarche Jabnuary 29 to Ministry for External Relations (MRE) Under Secretary for Political Affairs Vera Machado. Machado asked if the USG and P5+1 partners were seeking additional sanctions against Iran at the present time and if the issue had been placed on the UNSC agenda yet. Machado expressed concern about the position of China, saying that she believed China would oppose putting the matter on the UNSC agenda. When asked Brazil's views by ChargC), Machado said that the GOB would like to postpone any additional pressure against Iran because internal instability there would unify Iranians behind "extremist elements" in the face of external pressure. 

¶2. (C) In a separate discussion with PolOff, MRE Director for Disarmament Santiago Mourao asked about USG and P5+1 reaction to Iran's "counterproposal" to the IAEA plan for its low enriched uranium. He noted that Brazil did not believe new sanctions would be effective and said he understood that Russia and China shared this view. Mourao said he understood that the USG was seeking a "rebalancing" between engagement and pressure and would make sure his superiors understood this. 3. (U) The meeting with the Brazilian MRE occurred the day after Foreign Minister Celso Amorim met with Iranian Foreign Minister Motaki in Davos to hear what he described as "new ideas" as an alternative to the IAEA plan for nuclear fuel. Amorim warned that "threats and sanctions haven't been working. We are keeping a dialogue with (Iran)."
