SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S LULA OFFERS BOLIVIA'S MORALES TREATMENT 
FOR TUMOR 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Clifford M. Sobel, Reason 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) In a conversation with Ambassador Sobel following the 
January 15, 2009 La Paz meeting between Brazilian President 
Lula and Bolivian President Morales, Brazilian Defense 
Minister Nelson Jobim (protect) confirmed an earlier rumor 
that Morales is suffering from a serious sinus tumor.  Jobim 
told the Ambassador that Lula had offered Morales an 
examination and treatment at a Sao Paulo hospital.  Although 
there have been been public reports that Morales needs 
surgery for "acute sinusitis," and related otitis and 
headaches, according to Jobim his problems in fact are caused 
by a serious tumor and the surgery will be an effort to 
remove it.  Treatment has been put off, however, until after 
the constitutional referendum scheduled for January 25. 
Jobim, who attended the meeting between Lula and Morales, 
commented that the tumor might explain why Morales has seemed 
unfocussed and not his usual self at this and other recent 
meetings.
