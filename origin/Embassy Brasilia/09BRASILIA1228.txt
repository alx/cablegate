SUBJECT: BRIEFING ON OUTCOME OF P5+1 TALKS WITH IRAN IN GENEVA OCTOBER 1 

REF: SECSTATE 103219 Classified By: Political Counselor Stephen Liston. Reason: 1.4(d) 

¶1. (C) Post delivered the reftel message October 5 to Ministry for External Relations (MRE) Director for Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies Santiago Mourao. Mourao was well informed on the issue but was curious about the details of the proposal to provide fuel for the Teheran Research Reactor (TRR), including the levels of enrichment and the amount of Uranium Hexafloride to be exported to Russia for fuel manufacture. Mourao indicated that his office sought to keep informed on the situation and that Brazil would support the UN position, "even if Brazil disagrees." 

¶2. (C) Mourao explained that while Brazil supported Iran,s right to peaceful use of nuclear technology, there was now a "deficiency in international confidence" over the Iranian nuclear program, which Iran should seek to address. Further, he believed that IAEA Director General El Baradei,s analysis that Iran had been bound by the reporting requirement in Modified Code 3.1 and should have reported to the IAEA about the Qom facility when it was being designed, not at this late date. He added that he expected Iranian President Ahmadinejad to visit Brasilia in November or December and that this would be an opportunity for President Lula to "once again urge the Iranians for a peaceful solution."
