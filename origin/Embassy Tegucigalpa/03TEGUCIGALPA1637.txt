¶1. Editorial in Tegucigalpa-based moderate daily "El Heraldo" on 
7/10 entitled "Narco trafficking and violence". "Drug trafficking 
not only has the power to infiltrate the government and increase 
corruption, it is also an instigator of violence, as it has 
become evident in Colombia, Brazil or Mexico." 
 
"An accurate manifestation of the violence generated by drug 
trafficking is hired assassinations. About this, the Minister of 
Security Oscar Alvarez, has declared that drug cartels are 
training gang members or `mareros' to form an army of 
professional assassins in Honduras, to resolve the territorial 
conflicts and other disagreements derived from this illegal 
business." 
 
"In Honduras, violence generated by drug trafficking has not 
reached the extent of other countries. To avoid this, it is 
essential the determination of all law enforcement and judicial 
institutions and the collaboration of the honest citizenship in 
general. we still have time, but it is urgent to take the 
appropriate measures."
