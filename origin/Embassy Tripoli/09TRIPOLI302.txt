REF: STATE 35897 
 
(SBU) Ambassador delivered reftel points to Mahdi al-Majrabi, 
Director of International Organization Affairs at the General 
People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International 
Cooperation (MFA-equivalent) on April 12.  Al-Majrabi said the 
GPCFLIC was still studying the draft Presidential Statement but 
that he planned to recommend to FM-equivalent Musa Kusa that 
Libya support it at the Security Council meeting on April 13. 
Al-Majrabi offered that he was "impressed" that the P5 were able 
to find common ground and that he particularly liked the final 
statement of the draft language calling on Member States to 
facilitate a "peaceful and comprehensive solution through 
dialogue". Ambassador followed-up with Al-Majrabi morning of 
April 13 and was told instructions had been conveyed to the UN 
Libyan delegation to support the PRST.
