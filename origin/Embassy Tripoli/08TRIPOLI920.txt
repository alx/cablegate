REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 

¶1. (C) In a meeting with Qadhafi Development Foundation (QDF) 
Executive Director Yusuf Sawani, visiting NEA/MAG Director a
Stephanie Williams urged the GOL to release detained human 
rights activist Fathi el-Jahmi without conditions and facilitate 
his travel abroad for medical care if he chose to pursue that. 
Williams, accompanied by A/DCM, PAO and Econoff, met with Sawani 
on November 6.   She acknowledged the release of self-described 
regime critic Dr. Idriss Boufayed, who is critically ill with 
cancer, from detention on October 8 (ref A) as a positive 
development and urged that the QDF help facilitate his travel 
abroad for needed medical care.  Noting the interest of EU 
member states, she urged the QDF to do all it could to encourage 
the Government of Libya (GOL) to release the ten other members 
of Boufayed's group, who were arrested on the eve of a planned 
peaceful demonstration in Tripoli's Martyrs' Square in February 
2007 and sentenced to lengthy prison terms earlier this year 
(ref B). 
 
¶2. (C) Reprising arguments we've heard before, Sawani argued 
that el-Jahmi was mentally unstable and his own worst enemy. 
The QDF had made repeated efforts to secure his release, but he 
and his family had refused to take the steps necessary to 
facilitate that. (Note: As reported ref C and previous, el-Jahmi 
has rejected any conditions for his release, and has refused to 
permit his son, Muhammad, to sign an agreement that he would 
refrain from political statements and discussing his detention 
if he were released.  End note.)  El-Jahmi's U.S.-based brother, 
Muhammad el-Jahmi, had exploited Fathi el-Jahmi's case to pursue 
a political vendetta against al-Qadhafi and the GOL, Sawani 
said.  Sawani denied reports that the regime was quietly seeking 
to influence the el-Jahmi tribe to disown Fathi el-Jahmi as a 
precursor to liquidating him.  He stressed that the most senior 
levels of the GOL, including security officials, are aware of 
and invested in el-Jahmi's case, which made it difficult for the 
QDF to play a positive role.  On Boufayed, Sawani said the QDF 
was working to secure his passport and permission for him to 
travel.  He was noncommital on the possibility that the ten 
members of the Boufayed group remaining in detention would be 
released soon. 
 
¶3. (C) Separately, Sawani said talks between the QDF and 
imprisoned members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) 
were continuing and that release of a further tranche of LIFG 
members was expected by year's end, possibly in connection with 
the upcoming Eid al-Adha holiday.  (Note: As reported ref D, 
tranches of 131 and 40 LIFG members were released in April and 
June, respectively, in connection with talks under the auspices 
of the QDF.  End note.)  Acknowledging reports that there had 
been "handicaps" to efforts to reintegrate former LIFG members 
into Libyan society after their release, he stressed the QDF's 
emphasis on "transitional justice", i.e., financial 
compensation, restitution of legal and property rights and help 
with job placement for those released.  The extent to which 
former LIFG members are able to be rehabilitated and 
reintegrated into Libyan society would bear on Libya's domestic 
political reform efforts, he said.  Accordingly, Saif al-Islam 
al-Qadhafi, son of Muammar al-Qadhafi and Chairman of the QDF, 
continued to play a role in the ongoing discussions with 
imprisoned LIFG members.  Sawani expressed hope that U.S.-Libya 
relations would continue in the spirit of cooperation that had 
recently obtained, saying the GOL would otherwise cease its 
support for QDF initiatives like the LIFG talks.  (Comment: 
Sawani implied, but did not say, that the QDF's ability to 
mediate on human rights issues would be further circumscribed if 
the GOL sensed it was subject to external pressure.  End 
comment.)
