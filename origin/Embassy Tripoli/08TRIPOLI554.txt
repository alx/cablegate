¶1. (U)  On July 7th, the Political/Economic Assistants met with 
the Resident Representative of the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Dr. Saad Elmedani 
Ahmed.  According to Dr. Ahmed, the Libyan government (GOL) has 
generally taken prudent steps to protect Libyans from the 
worldwide foodstuffs shortages by continuing subsidization of 
essential staples while reducing fees and taxes on the import 
and distribution of food supplies in general. 
 
¶2. (U)  According to Dr. Ahmed, the General People's Committee 
for Economy, Trade and Investment has recently taken steps to 
mitigate the effects of worldwide increases in food prices by 
boosting the purchasing power of ordinary citizens.  These 
include: production, consumption, and import service tax 
exemptions for basic commodities; production tax exemptions for 
locally-produced products used in the production of other goods; 
production and consumption tax exemptions of production and 
operation tools; a 75% fee reduction for laboratory analysis of 
imported goods; a 50% reduction of fees for handling, storage 
and port processing of imported produce; and the establishment 
of a fund to achieve an equilibrium between prices and the 
average citizens' incomes to maintain their purchasing power and 
protect Libya's consumer economy from international prices 
fluctuations. 
 
¶3. (U)  Dr. Ahmed also mentioned Libyan efforts to use "virtual 
water" as a solution to its agricultural problems. He described 
"virtual water" as a mechanism by which water-poor states can 
achieve water and food security by purchasing water-intensive 
agricultural commodities from water-rich states that produce a 
natural surplus of these products.  Libya is developing 
partnerships with countries like Mali and Sudan in the field of 
virtual water trade; Libya invests in irrigated agriculture in 
those countries in exchange for the right to purchase all of the 
crops produced in those areas in which Libya has invested.  The 
produce is then bought by the GOL at a below-market price, 
offsetting the initial investment costs.  According to Dr. 
Ahmed, the scheme benefits both countries: Libya gets 
water-rich, high-quality agricultural products for its market 
and Sudan and Mali are able to provide employment and a steady 
export market to more farmers.
