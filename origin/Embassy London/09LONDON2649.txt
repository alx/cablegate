SUBJECT: UK BUDGET SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 
 
REF: STATE 120487 
 
¶1. (SBU) The UK is currently reviewing its plans for budget 
support for the Palestian Authority (PA) and expects to 
reach a decision by December 4, Alice Mann, Deputy Head 
(London), Palestinian Program at the Department for 
International Development, told ECOUNS. She stated that she 
is confident that the UK will provide additional assistance, 
having already provided GBP 18.5 million in budget support 
this year to the PA. Note: Foreign Secretary Miliband sent a 
letter to Secretary of State Clinton August 21 noting the 
UK's contribution this year and expressing that the UK was 
"keen to provide more budget support" and hoped to have 
further details on funding plans in early autumn. End Note. 
Mann said the timetable for such a decision had slipped given 
other pressing budget concerns. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mann told Econoff that she was pleased to see the 
U.S. reaching out to other countries for support. She noted 
that Foreign Ministery and DFID officials have been lobbying 
other countries, particularly the Saudis, to provide 
additional support.
