¶1. We delivered invitation letter and draft statement to the offices of UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband and the Secretary of State for International Development, Douglas Alexander, on Friday, 11 September.  In the UK, the Department for International Development, DFID, is the policy lead on food security issues.  As such, recommendations for the Foreign Secretary's attendance will be made by DFID.  2. DFID contacts told us September 14 that the decision on would attend was still pending, but that they expect high-level UK attendance, as food security remains a key foreign policy priority for the Foreign Office and DFID.  We will advise as soon as we have a decision from HMG.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
