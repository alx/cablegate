 Classified By: Political Counselor Richard M. Mills for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

¶1. (C) The UK concurs with the U.S. view (ref a) that political progress in Bosnia has either stopped or is moving in the wrong direction, and will use the time remaining before the November 10 GAERC to lobby its EU partners for a strong statement on Bosnia. According to FCO Bosnia Team Leader Daisy Organ, HMG is also very concerned about the unhelpful role Russia has been playing in the PIC Steering Board. On the EU front, except for the Swedes, Organ's perception is that most Member States are moving towards a harder, more stick than carrot approach given Prime Minister Dodik's recent rantings about Bosnia's dissolution and attempts to undermine Bosnian state institutions.

¶2. (C) Per ref B, Poloff will monitor the results of the ref A demarche as they are received from around EU posts, then reconfer with FCO on any countries of concern (according to Organ HMG already pressures the Swedes weekly), with an eye towards asking the FCO to apply influence where necessary in the run-up to the November 10 GAERC.

¶3. (C) HMG is also concerned that OHR Lajcak could do a better, more precise job of codifying the exact problems and proposed way ahead in Bosnia. According to Organ, this would give more ammo to those in the EU like the UK trying to keep the pressure on.

¶4. (C) Bio Note: Organ said that Mike Tatham will arrive shortly in Sarajevo to assume the post of Her Majesty's Ambassador. Post's experience with Tatham has been positive. He is accessible and knowledgeable on regional issues, having served until recently as FCO Balkans Director and previously in the UK Mission in Belgrade.
