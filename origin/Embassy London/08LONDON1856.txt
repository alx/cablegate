SUBJECT: UK SUPPORTS INDIA-IAEA SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 74896  Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Richard Mills, reasons 1.4 (b/d).  

¶1. (C/NF) In response to reftel demarche on the India-IAEA Safeguards Agreement, FCO Security Policy Group Officer Derek Griffiths said that the UK welcomes the agreement and supports the U.S. approach.  HMG agrees that the discussions should be technical, as opposed to political, and that the INFCIRC/66 is not a model for safeguard agreements. Griffiths said that EU Missions in Vienna will convene a meeting on July 16 to discuss the Safeguards Agreement and that London's instructions for that meeting will draw heavily on the points put forward in reftel.  

¶2. (C/NF) On one possible point of contention, Griffiths said FCO officials have decided to seek an internal legal opinion and ministerial approval on the current enrichment language in the agreement, mainly as "political cover," because it does "not tally with other HMG policies on enrichment." He did not expect any legal or political difficulties with the enrichment issue, saying that officials simply felt they needed to ensure the decision went through all the necessary bureaucratic approvals.
