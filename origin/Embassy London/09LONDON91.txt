SUBJECT: (C) UK UNDECIDED ON EU-SYRIA ASSOCIATION AGREEMENT 
 
REF: STATE 1985 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Richard Mills, reasons 1.4 b, d  1.  (C) UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband is undecided about whether to proceed with the EU-Syria Association Agreement, FCO Head of Levant Team Benjamin Saoul told us January 12 in response to reftel demarche.  Before the Gaza crisis, Miliband had been inclined to support the Agreement, Saoul said, on the grounds that the Syria Arab Republic Government (SARG) had generally exhibited good behavior internationally (despite lack of progress on key issues such exchanging ambassadors with Lebanon), and that Syrian FM Muallem needed a deliverable to strengthen him with President Assad.  The agreement has now fallen off Miliband's radar and will need to be reconsidered once the Gaza crisis ends, Saoul said.  2.  (C) HMG believes the time frame for the conclusion of the Agreement is likely to be June or later, FCO Syria/Lebanon Desk Officer Elizabeth McKinnell told us January 13.  She noted that an experts-level meeting on the Agreement has been scheduled for January 28, making it unlikely any action would be taken at the January 26-27 GAERC.  She also noted that before it can be concluded, the Agreement will need to be translated into all the EU languages, which could take several months.  Saoul told us that the UK Parliament will also have to ratify the Agreement before the UK can officially approve it, which could also take several months.
