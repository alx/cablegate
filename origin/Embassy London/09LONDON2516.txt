¶1. (U) Post delivered reftel demarch to the UK's Food Standards Agency Head of Incidence Response.  

¶2. (U) Since January 2005, the UK has had an internal mechanism for reporting potential food safety breaches that is very similar to the Reportable Food Registry (RFR).  It is known as its Online Incident Report Form, and can be accessed at: http://www.food.gov.uk/foodindustry/incidents /report  

¶3. (U) In reviewing the RFR, the UK offered a word of caution on it being potenially open to the filing of malicious reports by disgruntled employees or competitors, as is also the case with their online form.  Shortly after launch, the UK modified their Incident Report procedures so that there was a verification step built into the action cascade.  Now upon receipt of an Incident Report, a member of staff calls the company involved to check if it is a real report.  

¶4. (U) The UK is willing to share its experience in this area with the U.S., if FDA would find this helpful.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
