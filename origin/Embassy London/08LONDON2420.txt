SUBJECT: LUTE DELEGATION'S DISCUSSIONS ON AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN 

Classified By: Political Counselor Richard Mills, reasons 1.4 (b/d).

1.(C) Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan General Douglas Lute, accompanied by Counselor Eliot Cohen, A/S for South and Central Asia Richard Boucher, State Office of Policy Planning Director David Gordon, DoD A/S for Asian and Pacific Security Affairs James Shinn, held on September 18 - 19 wide ranging discussions on Afghanistan and Pakistan with their HMG counterparts, including Head of the Cabinet Office's Defense and Overseas Secretariat Margaret Aldred, FCO's Director of South Asia and Afghanistan Adam Thompson, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister Matt Cavanagh, MoD Deputy Chief of Defense Staff Lt. General Peter Wall, and MoD Director General Operational Policy Jon Day. Building on an analysis of the current situation and lessons learned in Afghanistan, the discussions focused on the future approach, highlighting the importance of clarity of objectives and the need to strike a balance between strategy and resources. Both sides agreed that it was important to consider Afghanistan and Pakistan jointly, given the current security dynamic along the border. On Afghanistan, the 2009 elections, national reconciliation, a re-newed focus on counter-insurgency strategies, and capacity-building within the Afghan government were agreed as priorities. On Pakistan, it was agreed the economy and strategies on security issues need attention. Striking the right balance on centralization versus de-centralization is important for both countries.

2.(C) Given the importance of a joint understanding on the way forward, both sides agreed to hold a further round of strategic discussions in Washington, DC in late November. The UK agreed to produce a note of the September discussions and to highlight issues requiring effort before the next meeting. Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
