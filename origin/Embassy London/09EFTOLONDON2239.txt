¶1. (SBU/NF) Summary: UK PM Gordon Brown,s announced GBP 50 million (USD 80 million) in additional assistance for Pakistan,s border areas will come from the current GBP 665 million (USD 1 billion) already designated for aid to Pakistan and is unlikely to be in place until spring 2010. End Summary.  

¶2. (SBU/NF) On September 25, at a U.S., UK and Pakistan co-chaired Friends of Democratic Pakistan meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly meeting in New York, Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced the UK will provide an additional 50 million GBP (USD 80 million) of assistance funding to improve infrastructure and security in Pakistan's volatile border region. 

¶3. (SBU/NF) Department for International Development (DFID) officials confirm these funds are not new, but are part of DFID's larger GBP 665 (USD 1 billion) current budget commitment for Pakistan aid.  The funds will not be shared among government departments; DFID and its partner NGOs will be completely responsible for planning and disbursement. 

¶4. (SBU/NF) DFID is awaiting the release of the World Bank (WB) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) joint Pos-Conflict Needs Assessment (PCNA) for Pakistan,s border areas in January 2010 before deciding how to spend the money.  Project design will rely heavily on the recommendations made by the PCNA.  DFID expects to focus on infrastructure creation, good governance, accountability and rule of law efforts.  Close coordination with the United States and other organizations working in the region is anticipated.  Project funds will be channeled through the Pakistan government at national, regional and local levels in an effort to build government legitimacy and capacity.
