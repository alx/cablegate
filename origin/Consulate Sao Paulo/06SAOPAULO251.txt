¶1.  SUMMARY: In late March, Brazil plans to send its first astronaut 
into space aboard a Russian rocket.  This event appears to be the 
first step in space-related cooperation between Brazil and Russia. 
Despite the historic significance of this flight for Brazil, the 
director of Brazil's National Space Agency has derided the event as 
a mere "publicity stunt."  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------ 
HITCHING A RIDE TO SPACE 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  On March 29, Air Force Lt. Col. Marcos Cesar Pontes will become 
Brazil's first person in space when he flies on a Russian Soyuz 
rocket to the International Space Station.  Pontes will blast off 
from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan with Russian astronaut 
Pavel Vinogradov and American astronaut Jeffrey Williams and spend 
eight days on the International Space Station before returning to 
Earth with the outgoing two-man crew. 
 
¶3.  Pontes began training in 1998 in the U.S.  After the GOB 
reevaluated their participation in the international space station, 
Pontes' participation with the U.S. crew was put on an indefinite 
hold.  Press reports indicate that in 2005, the GOB began 
discussions with Russia about the possibility of Pontes traveling 
aboard a Russian rocket.  During a November 2004 visit to Brazil, 
Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged Russian support to help 
Brazil resume its space program and restore its rocket-launching 
base, which was destroyed by a rocket explosion in 2003 that killed 
21 people.  Brazil and Russia signed an agreement for Ponte's space 
mission during Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's visit 
to Moscow in October 2005. 
 
¶4.  During the mission, Pontes will conduct nine scientific 
experiments in the sphere of nano-technology, bio-technology, and 
plant behavior in micro-gravitational conditions.  A former test 
pilot, Pontes, who is currently making final preparations for the 
flight at the Star City astronaut training center outside Moscow, 
told reporters, "I started as a technician on the railroad.  My 
first dream was to join the air force and fly fighter planes.  It 
wasn't until I was an Air Force pilot that I began to dream about 
space." 
 
¶5.  The last person to buy a ticket on a Soyuz rocket was American 
entrepreneur and scientist Gregory Olsen, who returned safely to 
earth October 2005.  Olsen paid an estimated USD 20 million for the 
trip. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
THE BEGINNING OF A BEAUTIFUL FREINDSHIP 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  The low price Brazil paid to Russia (supposedly USD 10.5 
million, versus Olsen's USD 20 million) was not just a friendly 
gesture.  According to Brazilian news reports, the Russian 
government considers Pontes' flight the first stage of cooperation 
between the two nations in the space sector and expects to win the 
bid for the construction of a Brazilian satellite.  The cooperation 
includes negotiations to use the Brazilian Alcantara facility 
(located in the northeastern state of Maranhao close to the equator) 
to launch Russian commercial satellites.  According to Moscow, the 
Alcantara base needs about USD 300 million worth of upgrades in 
order to become a launch center.  While not committing to the full 
amount needed to refurbish the site, the Russians are considering 
providing financial assistance for the upgrades. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
BRAZILIAN SPACE FLIGHT IS A MERE "PUBLICITY STUNT" 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶7.  COMMENT:  The new director of the Brazilian Aerospace Technology 
Center, Air Force Lt. Brigadier Carlos Augusto Leal Velloso, said in 
a recent interview with daily Folha de Sao Paulo that the Pontes's 
upcoming space flight is a mere "publicity stunt" that "will bring 
no scientific benefit to Brazil."    In an election year that has 
seen President Lula up and down in the polls, it isn't hard to 
imagine who the "publicity stunt" is meant to benefit.  This may be 
the final word in a mission that may ultimately be described as 
 
SAO PAULO 00000251  002 OF 002 
 
 
merely "one small step" for Brazil.  END COMMENT
