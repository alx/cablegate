SUBJECT: SURINAME: CHINESE SUGAR POT FOR GOVERNMENT 
COALITION CAUSES MEDIA FLURRY 

¶1. (SBU) Summary. The week of March 12, media coverage came 
fast and furious about the most recent Chinese government 
sugar pot of financial contributions to some political 
parties in Suriname's New Front Plus (ruling) Coalition. The 
media reported three of the New Front Plus Coalition members 
unashamedly acknowledged receipt of contributions from the 
Government of China (GOC), while others eschewed the 
practice. Ironically, in July 2007 the ruling coalition had 
adamantly protested as dollar diplomacy Taiwan's overtures 
to Suriname. Apparently, some of the New Front Plus 
Coalition is less concerned when the political donor is the 
GOC. End Summary. 

¶2. (SBU) On March 12, a media flurry broke over the Chinese 
government sugar pot of financial contributions for some 
political parties in Suriname's New Front Plus (ruling) 
Coalition. On March 5, former United Party for the Interior 
(BEP) Treasurer Nagesing Ajeki stated on the news broadcast 
Suriname Vandaag (Suriname Today) that BEP had dismissed 
him because he had questioned inappropriate usage of party 
funds. (Note: BEP is a member of the A-Combination, a 
coalition of three smaller political parties -- the General 
Liberation and Development Party (ABOP), Seeka, and BEP, that 
together form one member of Suriname's ruling coalition. End 
Note.) 

¶3. (SBU) On March 10, during an A-Combination meeting, Ronnie 
Brunswijk, ABOP Chair and A-Combination parliamentarian, 
raised the issue of these funds coming from a package of 
gifts from the Government of China (GOC). (Note: The gifts 
were given to a 12-member BEP delegation that traveled to 
China from September 3-10, 2007. The media reported that in 
addition to the all-expense paid trip, BEP party officials 
received between $80 and $125,000 dollars, and several 
student scholarships to China. End Note.) Brunswijk argued 
gifts to any A-Combination member should be shared with all 
members. 

¶4. (SBU) BEP chair and Deputy Speaker of the National 
Assembly Caprino Alendy reportedly responded that the 
invitation to visit China, financial gifts, and scholarships 
were explicitly directed to the BEP Party, and would not be 
shared. In return, the GOC apparently required BEP to 
support the One China Policy, according to one media 
report. Brunswijk, apparently unsatisfied with this 
response, made a public statement to the media. 

¶5. (SBU) In a domino effect, on March 13 and 14, three of 
four national papers reported on additional GOC financial 
gifts to other Surinamese political parties. De Ware Tijd 
(the newspaper of record) quoted the statement of Winston 
Jessurun, leader of Democratic 91 (DA91), another New Front 
Plus Coalition member party, that the GOC had made a generous 
contribution to the ruling coalition in the aftermath of 
Suriname's 2005 national election. This donation was 
distributed amongst the coalition member parties based on a 
distribution code. Jessurun's statement was echoed by United 
Reform Party (VHP) First Secretary Mahinder Rathipal, who 
said China has supported us, and has offered support when 
necessary, and by Pertjajah Luhur (PL) Vice Chair Ronny 
Tamsiran, who stated there is nothing wrong when a friendly 
nation donates money or goods to a political party. 

¶6. (SBU) Other coalition members sang a different tune. 
Surinamese Labor Party (SPA) Secretary for Foreign Relations 
John Defares said no SPA members had received gifts from the 
GOC. First Secretary Sunil Oemrawsing of the National Party 
of Suriname (NPS), the party of President Venetiaan, said 
media reports were absolutely, absolutely untrue. (Note: 
The NPS is the party of choice for many Chinese-origin 
Surinamers, and has a large China lobby within the party. 
End Note.) In the meantime, representatives of opposition 
parties Political Wing of the Federation of Agricultural 
Workers (PVF) and the National Democratic Party (NDP) said 
neither party had received gifts or trips to China. 

¶7. (SBU) Comment. In this media flurry, the tables turned on 
the GOC. Media coverage in the past has focused on ruling 
coalition complaints of Taiwan's dollar diplomacy overtures 
to Suriname, a hot topic in July 2007. Current reporting 
shows the Surinamese public that, in fact, the New Front Plus 
Coalition is of two minds on whether it is appropriate for 

PARAMARIBO 00000085 002 OF 002 


political parties to accept sugar pots. Apparently for some 
in the ruling coalition, dollar diplomacy is defined 
differently when the donor is the GOC rather than Taiwan. 
End Comment.
