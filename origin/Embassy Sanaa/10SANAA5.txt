Classified By: Ambassador Stephen Seche, reasons 1.4 (c, d and g) 
 
¶1.  (S/NF) On January 4, 2010 the Ambassador convened Post's Emergency Action Committee (EAC). Attendees included DCM, MO, 
POLMIL, LEGAT, DAO, FPD, SOCFWD, CONS, PD, IPC, OMC, POLECON, GSO, MSG, USAID, MSG, and RSO. 
 
¶2.  (S/NF)  GRPO Chief briefed the EAC on the background of the threat that prompted suspension of Embassy operations January 3, and measures taken  earlier in the day by ROYG security forces to mitigate that threat.  He noted that the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) had interdicted a vehicle shortly after it had departed from the compound of Mohamed Hanak, the AQ "emir" of Arhab, and the individual believed to be facilitating the movement of suicide bombers into Sana'a from that location north of the capital.  The four passengers in the vehicle attempted to flee on foot, and in an exchange of gunfire that followed, CTU soldiers managed to wound several of them.  Neither the nature of their injuries nor their identities are known at this time because individuals associated with local tribes arrived immediately on the scene and carried the bodies away. 
 
¶3.  (S/NF)  The Ambassador, GRPO Chief and RSO all agreed that the operation, while imperfect, would likely disrupt substantially the specific threat posed by the AQ cell in Arhab that had prompted the suspension of operations and permit the Embassy to reopen under the same conditions and threat level that generally prevail in Yemen. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The Ambassador recommended, and the EAC agreed, that town-hall meetings be held on January 5 for both LE Staff and USDH staff to brief them appropriately on events of recent days.  Post will submit a draft press statement for Departmental approval, and the Ambassador is contacting relevant Department officials to obtain formal concurrence with this plan. 
 
¶5.  (U) POC for this reporting is RSO John C. Taylor at 967-1-755-2218 (Open) or 967-1-130-3178 (STE).
