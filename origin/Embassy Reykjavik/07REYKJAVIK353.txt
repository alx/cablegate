¶1.  Icelandic President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson said the 
assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto "was 
a deplorable reminder of the sacrifices that are always made when 
the consolidation of democracy is attempted." Grimsson added, 
"Benazir Bhutto was a respected leader that firmly warned against 
terrorism and extremist forces. She was highly educated and open 
minded; I became well aware of that during our conversations in 
previous years, [where she] radiated energy and fighting spirit. She 
possessed a deep understanding of the common interests of the West 
and the Islamic world. The forces of reconciliation have now lost a 
strong leader." 
 
¶2.  Icelandic Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir strongly 
condemned the assassination, calling it "disastrous, not only for 
Pakistan, but for the whole world." Gisladottir said that Bhutto had 
raised hopes of restoring democracy in Pakistan, and that it will be 
difficult to fill her shoes.
