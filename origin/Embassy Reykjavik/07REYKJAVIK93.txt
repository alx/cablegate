(C) As Iceland's formal response to demarche (ref c), MFA Minister 
Counselor Nikulas Hannigan told A/Poloff on March 30 they strongly 
support Martti Ahtisaari's proposal for a lasting settlement on the 
status of Kosovo and that it would provide a basis for a 
multi-ethnic, democratic society.  Hannigan further said that Iceland 
believes it is of key importance for peace in the region that the 
Security Council takes a clear position in favor of this proposal.
