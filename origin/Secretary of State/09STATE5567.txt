Background

----------

¶2. (S/NF) Ref A asked Sudan to stop flights from Sudan which we believed are carrying lethal military equipment. Earlier Washington advised Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, and Yemen in Ref B with updated information that additional flights may be planned for , which we are concerned could also be used to transfer arms from Iran to Sudan. Ref C advised that Washington had received information that the UAE firm requested overflight permission from the Civil Aviation Authority in Yemen for to conduct flights on between Iran and Sudan. Ref D advised Egyptian authorities that may be involved in the transfer of arms to Hamas. Ref E informed that Iran intended to conduct arms shipments to Hamas via Sudan and that the arms were expected to be transferred via aerial routes using cargo planes.

Objectives

-- Inform host governments of this new information regarding flights and that we have reason to believe the flight will be transporting lethal military equipment.

-- Inform the host government additional flights may be planned for .

-- Ask host nation to stop the flights.

-- Ask to be provided information that is regularly required for overflight requests.

-- Emphasize that UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1747, paragraph 5, states Iran shall not supply, sell or transfer directly or indirectly any arms of related materiel, whether or not originating in Iran.

-- Stress to Sudan the United States considers this activity exceptionally concerning, particularly as our two countries are working together towards critical issues of UN/African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) deployment, resolution of the situation in Darfur, and implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA).
