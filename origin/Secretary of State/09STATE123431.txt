SUBJECT: ATTEMPTS BY IRANIAN FIRM TO ACQUIRE MACHINE TOOLS 
FROM BRAZIL (S) 
 
Classified By: ISN/MTR DIRECTOR PAM DURHAM FOR REASONS 1.4 (B), 
(C), AND (D). 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request.  Embassy Brasilia, 
Please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (S) Background:  We want to alert the government of 
Brazil to a possible effort by the Iranian firm Machine 
Sazi Tabriz to acquire machine tools from a Brazilian company. 
Machine Sazi Tabriz is the largest manufacturer of machine 
tools in Iran and has likely supplied imported machine tools 
to Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Because we 
are concerned that any export of machine tools to Machine Sazi 
Tabriz potentially could be diverted to Iran's Weapons 
development programs, we want to share this information with 
Brazilian officials and ask that they investigate this 
activity.  We also want to request that they take all 
appropriate measures, including the use of their catch-all 
controls, to closely scrutinize all machine tool exports to 
Iran to prevent such equipment from being used to support 
programs of proliferation concern. 
 
¶3. (U) Action Request: Request Embassy Brasilia approach 
appropriate host government officials to deliver talking 
points in paragraph 4 and report response.  Talking point 
may also be left as a non-paper. 
 
¶4. (S) Begin talking points/non-paper: 
 
(SECRET//REL BRAZIL) 
 
-- We would like to alert you to information of potential 
proliferation concern and request your assistance in 
investigating this activity. 
 
-- The United States has information that in October 2009 
Iran's Machine Sazi Tabriz was working to finalize a 
purchase of machine tools from Brazil's Mello S.A. Maquinas e 
Equipamentos.  The Iranian intermediary Poshtiban Abzar 
Parswas helping to facilitate this transaction. 
 
-- Machine Sazi Tabriz is the largest machine tool 
manufacturer in Iran and likely supplies some imported 
machine tools to Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile 
programs. 
 
-- We are bringing this matter to your attention to 
Support your export control efforts as we are concerned that 
Machine Sazi Tabriz could potentially be seeking machines from 
Brazil on behalf of weapons-related end-users in Iran. 
 
-- In addition, UN Security Council Resolution 1737 
Requires states to take necessary measures to prevent the 
supply, sale or transfer of items that a state determines 
would Contribute to Iran's ballistic missile or nuclear- 
related activities. 
 
-- We hope you will investigate this activity and use your 
catch-all authorities to closely scrutinize all machine 
tool exports to Iran to ensure that such equipment is not used 
to support weapons development applications. 
 
-- We look forward to continued cooperation on export 
Control and nonproliferation issues and would appreciate 
hearing of the actions you take in response to this 
information at The earliest possible time.
