Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty,

Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in assisting the Afghan 
Government to improve the security situation and welcoming 
the cooperation of the Afghan Government with ISAF, 
 
Recognizing once again the interconnected nature of the 
challenges in Afghanistan, reaffirming that sustainable 
progress on security, governance and development, as well as 
the cross-cutting issue of counter-narcotics is mutually 
reinforcing and welcoming the continuing efforts of the 
Afghan Government and the international community to address 
these challenges through a comprehensive approach, 
 
Stressing in this context the need for further efforts by the 
Afghan Government to fight corruption, promote transparency 
and increase its accountability, 
 
Stressing the central and impartial role that the United 
Nations continues to play in promoting peace and stability in 
Afghanistan by leading the efforts of the international 
community, noting, in this context, the synergies in the 
objectives of the United Nations Assistance Mission in 
Afghanistan (UNAMA) and of ISAF, and stressing the need for 
strengthened cooperation, coordination and mutual support, 
taking due account of their respective designated 
responsibilities, 
 
Expressing its strong concern about the security situation in 
Afghanistan, in particular the increased violent and 
terrorist activities by the Taliban, Al-Qaida, illegally 
armed groups, criminals and those involved in the narcotics 
trade, and the increasingly strong links between terrorism 
activities and illicit drugs, resulting in threats to the 
local population, including children, national security 
forces and international military and civilian personnel, 
 
Encouraging ISAF to further, effectively support, within its 
designated responsibilities, Afghan-led sustained efforts to 
address, in cooperation with relevant international and

of and trafficking in drugs, and recognizing the important 
role played by the UNODC in fighting the negative impact of 
drug production and trade on security and stability in the 
region, 
 
Expressing also its concern over the harmful consequences of

full enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, 
 
Reiterating its support for the continuing endeavours by the 
Afghan Government, with the assistance of the international 
community, including ISAF and the Operation Enduring Freedom 
(OEF) coalition, to improve the security situation and to 
continue to address the threat posed by the Taliban, Al-Qaida 
and other extremist groups, and stressing in this context the 
need for sustained international efforts, including those of 
ISAF and the OEF coalition, 
 
Condemning in the strongest terms all attacks, including 
Improvised Explosive Device (IED) attacks, suicide attacks 
and abductions, targeting civilians and Afghan and 
international forces and their deleterious effect on the 
stabilization, reconstruction and development efforts in 
Afghanistan, and condemning further the use by the Taliban, 
Al-Qaida and other extremist groups of civilians as human 
shields, 
 
Recognizing the increased threats posed by the Taliban, 
Al-Qaida and other extremist groups as well as the challenges 
related to the efforts to address such threats, expressing 
its serious concern with the high number of civilian 
casualties in this context, and calling for compliance with 
international humanitarian and human rights law and for all 
appropriate measures to be taken to ensure the protection of 
civilians, 
 
Recognizing additional efforts taken by ISAF and other 
international forces to minimize the risk of civilian 
casualties, welcoming their intention to undertake continued 
enhanced efforts in this regard including the increased focus 
on protecting the Afghan population as a central element of 
the mission, and noting the importance of conducting 
continuous reviews of tactics and procedures and after-action 
reviews and investigations in cooperation with the Afghan 
Government in cases where civilian casualties have occurred 
and when the Afghan Government finds these joint 
investigations appropriate, 
 
Acknowledging the progress made in security sector reform, 
welcoming supports provided by the international partners in 
this regard, in particular the establishment of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Training Mission in 
Afghanistan, the planned European Gendarmerie Force (EGF) 
contribution to this mission and assistance extended to the 
Afghan National Police including through the European Union 
police mission (EUPOL Afghanistan), and stressing the need 
for Afghanistan together with international donors to further 
strengthen the Afghan National Army and the Afghan National 
Police, and  increase its efforts in disbandment of illegal 
armed groups, and counter narcotics, 
 
Stressing in this context the importance of further progress 
by the Afghan Government in ending impunity and strengthening 
judicial institutions, the rule of law and respect for human 
rights within Afghanistan, including for women and girls and 
in the reconstruction and reform of the prison sector in 
Afghanistan, 
 
Reiterating its call on all Afghan parties and groups to 
engage constructively in peaceful political dialogue within 
the framework of the Afghan Constitution and to work together 
with international donors for the socio-economic development 
of the country and to avoid resorting to violence including 
through the use of illegal armed groups, and encouraging the

this regard,

an effective means to promote security, governance and 
development in Afghanistan and welcoming the regional efforts 
in this regard,

coalition, and the cooperation established between ISAF and 
the European Union presence in Afghanistan,

NATO, and for the contributions of many nations to ISAF and 
to the OEF coalition, including its maritime interdiction 
component, which operates within the framework of the 
counter-terrorism operations in Afghanistan and in accordance 
with the applicable rules of international law, 
 
Determining that the situation in Afghanistan still 
constitutes a threat to international peace and security,
