¶1.  SUMMARY:  UN FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) 
OFFICIALS BRIEFED DONORS MAY 21 ON THE SITUATION IN 
SELECTED COUNTRIES (INCLUDING IRAQ) RECEIVING EMERGENCY 
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE THROUGH FAO.  FAO 
WELCOMED INCREASING DONOR SUPPORT FOR EMERGENCIES BUT 
NOTED THAT MANY APPEALS WERE STILL UNDERFUNDED.  IN THE 
CASE OF IRAQ, FAO STAFF STATED THAT AFTER YEARS OF 
IMPLEMENTING THE AGRICULTURAL PORTION OF THE OIL FOR FOOD 
(OFF) PROGRAM, FAO HAD THE IN-COUNTRY PERSONNEL AND THE 
CAPACITY TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO IRAQ'S 
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION -- IF ADEQUATELY FUNDED.  THE 
PRESENCE OF THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM'S (WFP) SENIOR 
EMERGENCY COORDINATOR AT THE PODIUM UNDERSCORED WHAT 
APPEARS TO BE IMPROVED COORDINATION BETWEEN THE FAO AND 
WFP ON THE POST-EMERGENCY REHABILITATION CONTINUUM.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  FAO OFFICIALS BRIEFED DONORS MAY 21, 2003 ON THE 
SITUATION IN SELECTED COUNTRIES RECEIVING EMERGENCY 
AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE THROUGH FAO.  THE 
FOCUS OF THE BRIEFING WAS PRIMARILY "POST-CONFLICT" 
COUNTRIES, ALTHOUGH SOUTHERN AFRICA WAS COVERED AS WELL.

IRAQ 
---- 
 
¶3.  FAO OFFICIALS CHARACTERIZED THE SITUATION IN IRAQ AS 
"VERY DIFFICULT" AS FAR AS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD 
PRODUCTION.  FAO HAS BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE AGRICULTURAL 
SEGMENT OF THE OIL FOR FOOD (OFF) PROGRAM SINCE 1997 AND 
HAS DISBURSED OVER USD 450 MILLION IN INPUTS.  IN CENTRAL 
AND SOUTH IRAQ, FAO OBSERVED GOVERNMENT OF IRAQ (GOI) 
INPUT DISTRIBUTION TO BENEFICIARIES; IN THE CASE OF DUAL 
USE PRODUCTS, CERTIFIED THAT THEY WERE INTENDED FOR 
AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES.  IN THE NORTHERN GOVERNATES, FAO 
FULLY IMPLEMENTED THE AGRICULTURAL PROGRAM BY PROVIDING 
INPUTS IN SUPPORT OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL 
REHABILITATION, SUCH AS VACCINATION OF LIVESTOCK AND WELL 
DRILLING.  FAO HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A 13 YEAR 
REHABILITATION PLAN FOR THE NORTHERN GOVERNATES WHICH FAO 
OFFICIALS RECOMMENDED TO "THE NEW AUTHORITIES." 
 
¶4.  FAO OFFICIALS RECALLED THAT THE UN USD 2.2 BILLION 
FLASH APPEAL CONTAINED A USD 87 MILLION AGRICULTURAL 
COMPONENT.  ACCORDING TO THE FAO, 30 PERCENT OF THE 
POPULATION LIVES IN RURAL AREAS AND ONE THIRD OF THE 
COUNTRY'S FOOD REQUIREMENTS ARE GROWN NATIONALLY: 
AGRICULTURE MUST BE A PRIORITY.  AT THE SAME TIME, MUCH 
AS THE COUNTRY HAS DEPENDED ON FOOD RATIONS, SO 
AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN DEPENDENT ON STATE SUPPLIED INPUTS; 
ACCORDING TO THE FAO, THE IRAQI AGRICULTURAL SECTOR 
"CANNOT NOW FUNCTION WITHOUT SUPPORT." 
 
¶5.  ACKNOWLEDGING THAT FOOD AID NEEDS WERE BEING MET, FAO 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  02370  01 OF 04  290702Z 
STAFF CAUTIONED THAT THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION SIDE WAS 
"NOT IN SUCH GOOD SHAPE."  A WHEAT HARVEST ESTIMATED AT 
700,000 TONS WAS IN NEED OF IMMEDIATE SUPPORT IN THE FORM 
OF TRUCKS FOR TRANSPORT, SPARE PARTS FOR COMBINES AND 
FUEL.  FAO STRESSED THAT THE TOP PRIORITY WAS THE CURRENT 
HARVEST AND THE CURRENT PLANTING SEASON.  CONCERNING 
SEED, FAO REPORTED THAT PREVIOUSLY SEED WAS NOT IMPORTED 
--  ALL NATIONAL NEEDS WERE OBTAINED FROM FARMERS. 
HOWEVER, FOR THE NEXT SEASON, THEY ANTICIPATED HAVING TO 
"IMPORT MASSIVELY." 
 
¶6.  ON POULTRY PRODUCTION, FAO STATED THAT 4,000 FARMS 
HAD BEEN PRODUCING POULTRY.  THEY NOTED THAT POULTRY WAS 
AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF PROTEIN, AS MEAT WAS NOT PROVIDED 
IN THE FOOD RATION.  MANY FARMS WERE NOT FUNCTIONING; 
BIRDS HAD DIED, THERE WAS NO ELECTRICITY.  IRAQ'S 1.5 
MILLION CATTLE AND 18 MILLION SHEEP AND GOATS NEEDED 
VACCINES, BUT COLD CHAINS NEEDED TO BE RESTORED BEFORE 
VACCINES WERE PROVIDED. 
 
¶7.  FAO STRESSED THAT THE ORGANIZATION HAS THE IN-COUNTRY

NATIONALS, THE EXPERIENCE AND THE CAPACITY TO PLAY A 
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN IRAQ'S AGRICULTURAL REHABILITATION. 
TO DATE, HOWEVER, ONLY THE UK HAD PROVIDED USD 2.2 
MILLION FOR POULTRY AND VEGETABLE PRODUCTION.  IN URGING 
DONOR SUPPORT, FAO OFFICIALS NOTED THAT EXISTING 
CONTRACTS UNDER THE OFF PROGRAM WAS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE 
SITUATION BEFORE THE CURRENT CRISIS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THEY 
HAVE EXISTING CONTRACTS FOR POULTRY FEED, BUT NOT FOR 
VACCINES, DRUGS AND INFRASTRUCTURE REPAIR.  (FURTHERMORE, 
FAO HAD THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD COUNT ON RESOURCES WITHIN 
COUNTRY, BUT USD 500 MILLION OF AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS 
IN STORAGE HAD BEEN STOLEN AND THE FAO OFFICES IN BAGHDAD 
WERE LOOTED.)  THAT BEING SAID, ACCORDING TO ASSISTANT 
DIRECTOR GENERAL (ADG) HENRI CARSALADE, FAO IS REVISING 
ITS SHARE OF THE UN APPEAL TO REFLECT ITS ASSESSMENT OF 
THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS 
NO OVERLAP WITH OFF. 
 
¶8. DONOR QUESTIONS FOCUSED ON THE ABSENCE OF MARKET 
MECHANISMS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND THE NEED FOR 
FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS.  FAO OFFICIALS AGREED ON THE NEED 
FOR REFORMS, NOTING THAT FAO HAD BEEN WORKING ON THIS 
ISSUE SINCE BEFORE THE CONFLICT.  ADG CARSALADE STATED 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 03        ROME  02370  02 OF 04  290702Z 
THAT "ONCE THE AUTHORITIES ARE GIVEN LEGITIMACY BY THE 
UN" THE FAO WOULD BE ABLE TO "OFFER PROPOSALS FOR FAR- 
REACHING REFORM TO THE AUTHORITIES." 
 
AFGHANISTAN -- MOVING FROM INPUTS TO POLICY 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶9.  IN 2002, ENDOWED WITH FULL FUNDING FROM DONORS (SOME 
USD 44 MILLION), FAO FOCUSED ON PROVIDING AGRICULTURAL 
INPUTS SUCH AS SEEDS, LOCUST CONTROL AND PROVISION OF 
CHICKS AND EGGS.  ACCORDING TO FAO OFFICIALS THESE INPUTS 
SUCCESSFULLY REACHED "ALL CORNERS" OF AFGHANISTAN, 
INCLUDING REFUGEES AND INTERNALLY DISPLACED. 
 
¶10. FAO IS MOVING AWAY FROM INPUTS IN 2003 AND TOWARDS 
POLICY ADVICE AND TRAINING FOR THE MINISTRY OF 
AGRICULTURE (MINAG).  ULTIMATELY FAO HOPES TO MOVE FOOD 
SECURITY AND EARLY WARNING ACTIVITIES INTO THE MINAG.  A 
SAMPLE OF CURRENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDE: TRAINING FOR 
GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN OFFICIALS TO PUT IN PLACE 
LOCUST CONTROL MEASURES; PERFORMING, WITH THE MINAG, A 
SURVEY ON WATER RESOURCES AND IRRIGATION; A SURVEY ON THE 
HORTICULTURE SECTOR, INCLUDING STUDIES ON MARKETING AND 
POST-HARVEST.  FAO SUPPORT FOR VACCINATION AGAINST 
LIVESTOCK DISEASES (INCLUDING FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE, 
ANTHRAX, NEWCASTLE DISEASE AND SHEEP POX) CONTINUES TO BE 
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, NOT ONLY FOR AFGHANISTAN, BUT TO 
PROTECT LIVESTOCK IN NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.  FAO AND WFP 
WILL FIELD AN ANNUAL CROP ASSESSMENT MISSION IN JUNE 
¶2003. 
 
OPIUM POPPY CULTIVATION 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  02370  02 OF 04  290702Z 
----------------------- 
 
¶11.  FAO ASSISTANT DIRECTOR GENERAL HENRI CARSALADE NOTED 
THAT OPIUM PRODUCTION HAD "EXPLODED" IN 2002; THE AREAS 
WHERE POPPY WAS GROWN (SOME 40 PERCENT OF ARABLE LAND) 
WERE KNOWN AND MAPPED, BUT THE AREAS WERE "NOT CONTROLLED 
BY THE CENTRAL AUTHORITIES."  FAO IS COLLABORATING WITH 
THE UN OFFICE OF DRUG CONTROL POLICY (UNDCP) TO DEVELOP 
PROPOSALS FOR ALTERNATIVE LIVELIHOODS TO OPIUM POPPY 
CULTIVATION, FOCUSING ON EXPANDING TRADITIONAL CROPS AND 
IN LINE WITH THE GOA'S SOON TO BE FINALIZED NATIONAL DRUG 
CONTROL STRATEGY.  FAO OFFICIALS NOTED THAT FAO HAS 
INITIATED FAO'S SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR FOOD SECURITY (SPFS) 
IN AFGHANISTAN, AND THAT TWO OF THE SPFS PROJECTS ARE TO 
BE IN POPPY-GROWING AREAS.  (COMMENT: SPFS PROJECTS ARE 
TYPICALLY PILOT-TYPE PROJECTS CO-FUNDED BY FAO AND THE 
HOST GOVERNMENT.  END COMMENT). AFGHAN PRESIDENT KARZAI 
HAD ALSO REQUESTED FAO SUPPORT FOR REFORESTATION, AND FAO 
WILL BE DEVELOPING PROPOSALS IN THAT AREA.

¶12.  ACCORDING TO ANNE BAUER, DIRECTOR OF FAO'S EMERGENCY 
OPERATIONS AND REHABILITATION DIVISION, THE LATEST APPEAL 
FOR AFGHANISTAN, ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2002, CONTAINED A USD 
44 MILLION COMPONENT FOR AGRICULTURE.  SHE NOTED THAT 
DONORS HAD NOT YET RESPONDED AS GENEROUSLY AS IN 2002 AND 
SHE APPEALED TO DONORS TO FUND THE ACTIVITIES, "OR ELSE 
FAO WILL NEED TO SCALE DOWN DRAMATICALLY IN AFGHANISTAN." 
 
SOUTHERN AFRICA -- LOOKING THROUGH THE HIV/AIDS LENS 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
¶13.  FAO OFFICIALS NOTED THAT THE FOOD EMERGENCY IN 
SOUTHERN AFRICA WAS "NOT JUST A DROUGHT-INDUCED CRISIS" 
AND CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT, EVEN WITH 
IMPROVING WEATHER AND CROPS, SOME 15 MILLION HIV/AIDS 
VICTIMS WOULD STILL NEED SOME FORM OF FOOD AID.  WFP 
OFFICIAL FRANCESCO STRIPPOLI ADDED THAT THE SITUATION IN 
ZIMBABWE AND SOUTHERN MOZAMBIQUE WAS "NOT VERY 
PROMISING;" A REGIONAL EMERGENCY OPERATION WAS STILL 
NEEDED, BUT "LOWER THAN THE CURRENT ONE." HE NOTED THAT 
THE SITUATION IN ZIMBABWE WAS CAUSED BY "GOVERNANCE" 
PROBLEMS.

PAGE 03        ROME  02370  03 OF 04  290702Z 
¶14.  FAO OFFICIALS STATED THAT THEY HAD RAISED SOME USD 
17 MILLION -- ABOUT 70 PERCENT OF THE APPEAL.  THEY HAVE 
BENEFITED SOME 500,000 HOUSEHOLDS WITH SEEDS, TOOLS, 
LIVESTOCK REPLENISHMENT, ANIMAL DISEASE CONTROL AND 
DROUGHT AND LABOR-SAVING TOOLS AND PRACTICES.  FAO 
OFFICIALS STATED THAT, LOOKING UPSTREAM, THEY WOULD 
"REVIEW EVERYTHING FAO DOES IN THE REGION THROUGH THE 
HIV/AIDS LENS."  THIS INCLUDES ADDING NEW INDICATORS FOR 
EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS AND TARGETING ELDERLY WOMEN AND 
ORPHANS("THOSE WHO BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE CRISIS.") 
 
¶15.  DONOR COMMENTS ON SOUTHERN AFRICA FOCUSED ON 
ZIMBABWE, PARTICULARLY QUESTIONS ON FAO'S "DIALOGUE WITH 
THE GOVERNMENT" CONCERNING OPENING MARKETS AND THE 
SITUATION OF DISPLACED COMMERCIAL FARMERS AND FARM 
WORKERS. FAO OFFICIALS RESPONDED THAT THE "SITUATION IN 
ZIMBABWE REMAINS VERY SERIOUS."  CONCERNING THE MOST 
RECENT CROP ASSESSMENT, FAO OFFICIAL HENRI JOSSERAND 
STATED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE WAS STILL 
"DEFINING ITS POSITION POSITION" AS REGARDS THIS YEAR'S 
HARVEST." 
 
ANGOLA 
------- 
¶16.  FAO OFFICIALS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED THE SITUATION IN 
ANGOLA.  IN 2002, DONORS (PRIMARILY THE UNITED STATES AND 
JAPAN) PROVIDED FUNDS FOR SEEDS AND TOOLS. IN 2003 THE 
FAO APPEAL IS FOCUSING ON ASSISTANCE TO INTERNALLY 
DISPLACED (IDP) ANGOLANS.  WITH THE USD 7.5 MILLION 
ALREADY RAISED (INCLUDING FROM THE UNITED STATES) THEY 
EXPECT TO REACH SOME 360,000 HOUSEHOLDS.  THE FUNDS 
                       UNCLASSIFIED 
 
PAGE 04        ROME  02370  03 OF 04  290702Z 
RAISED, HOWEVER, ARE SHORT OF THE APPEAL.  FAO CALLED THE 
CAMPAIGN TO REACH RETURNING IDPS "THE LARGEST CAMPAIGN 
ANYWHERE." 
 
SRI LANKA - SIMULTANEOUS PROGRAMMING OF EMERGENCY AND 
DEVELOPMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶17.  THE JUNE 9-10 PLEDGING CONFERENCE IN TOKYO WILL 
ENABLE FAO TO EMBARK ON A DETAILED PROJECT PREPARATION 
FOR SRI LANKA.  FAO OFFICIALS REPORTED THAT "SINCE THE 
PEACE PROCESS WAS MOVING POSITIVELY" IN SRI LANKA, THEY 
WERE DOING "SIMULTANEOUS PROGRAMMING" OF DEVELOPMENT AND 
EMERGENCY ACTIVITIES.  TWENTY YEARS OF CONFLICT HAS 
RESULTED IN REDUCED AREAS OF CULTIVATION, LIVESTOCK LOST 
AND FISHING AFFECTED BY DESTRUCTION OF FISHING 
INFRASTRUCTURE.  FAO'S USD 135 MILLION APPEAL IS INTENDED 
TO WORK ON IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL AND HUMAN RESOURCE 
CAPACITY, IMPROVE ACCESS TO PRODUCTION ASSETS AND START 
INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION.

SUDAN 
------ 
 
¶18.  FAO FIELDED AN ASSESSMENT MISSION TO SUDAN IN 
FEB/MARCH OF 2003. BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT: THE 
PEACE AGREEMENT WILL REMAIN FRAGILE; INSECURITY WILL 
INCREASE IN POCKETS; ACCESS WILL INCREASE; NATURAL 
RESOURCE-BASED CONFLICTS WILL CONTINUE AND BUILDING 
CAPACITY FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE AND INSTITUTIONS WILL TAKE A 
WHILE, FAO IS DEVELOPING A STRATEGIC APPROACH BASED ON 
THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS.  THIS INCLUDES: USING 
RELIEF TO LEVERAGE DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES, INTEGRATING 
CAPACITY BUILDING WITH RELIEF AND RECOVERY USING MARKET 
BASED INPUTS, WORKING WITH OTHER ACTORS (IOM, WFP AND 
UNICEF) ON REINTEGRATION OF IDPS.  IN THE SHORT TERM, FAO 
IS FOCUSING ON IMPROVING PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY OF THE 
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR.  OF THE USD 320 MILLION FOR THE UN'S 
"QUICK START" PROGRAM, USD 127 IS FOR FOOD AID, AND USD 
27 MILLION IS FOR AGRICULTURE

FAO AND WFP WERE "AT A NEW STAGE OF HIGHLY INTEGRATED 
COOPERATION."  ACCORDING TO STRIPPOLI, THE TWO 
ORGANIZATIONS WERE "TAKING STOCK" OF WHERE THEY WORK 
TOGETHER, AND MOVING FORWARD BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED. 
CURRENTLY THEY ARE WORKING ON IMPROVING JOINT ASSESSMENT 
METHODOLOGY AND ON HIV/AIDS AND HAVE RECENTLY SIGNED AN 
AGREEMENT ON "LOGISTICS AND MUTUAL SUPPORT IN THE FIELD."
