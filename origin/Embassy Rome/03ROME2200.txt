SUBJECT: MARTINO OUTLINES DEPLOYMENT TO IRAQ FOR PARLIAMENT 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  ITALIAN MOD MARTINO TOLD PARLIAMENT MAY 14 THAT 
A CONTINGENT OF ABOUT 3000 MILITARY PERSONNEL WILL BE 
DEPLOYED AND OPERATIONAL IN IRAQ BY MID-JULY.  TWO MINESWEEPS 
THAT ARE ALREADY IN THEATER WILL BECOME OPERATIONAL SOONER. 
AN ADVANCE TEAM WILL DEPART FOR IRAQ WITHIN DAYS TO ASSESS 
ON-THE-GROUND NEEDS FOR THE TROOPS.  PARLIAMENT APPROVED 
MILITARY SUPPORT IN AN APRIL 15 VOTE ON ITALY,S 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION, AND THE GOI IS FUNDING 
THE DEPLOYMENT THROUGH AN EXPEDITED PROCESS.  THE TROOPS ARE 
SEPARATE FROM THE UNIT OF CARABINIERI THAT DEPARTED MAY 15 
FOR IRAQ TO PROTECT THE ITALIAN RED CROSS FIELD HOSPITAL IN 
BAGHDAD, ACCORDING TO MARTINO.  THE CENTER-RIGHT COALITION 
PRAISED MARTINO FOR KEEPING PARLIAMENT FULLY INFORMED AND 
APPROVED THE MISSION.  THE CENTER-LEFT OPPOSITION CRITICIZED 
THE GOI FOR ITS SUBSERVIENCE TO THE U.S.  END SUMMARY. 
 
MISSION IS HUMANITARIAN, PARLIAMENT TO APPROVE FUNDING ONLY 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
¶2.  MOD MARTINO APPEARED BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF THE SENATE 
AND CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DEFENSE 
COMMITTEES MAY 14 TO BRIEF ON THE PLANNED DEPLOYMENT OF 
ITALIAN TROOPS TO IRAQ.  HE STRESSED THAT THE MISSION -- CODE 
NAMED "ANCIENT BABYLONIA" -- IS FOR HUMANITARIAN AND 
RECONSTRUCTION PURPOSES, AND TO PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT TO THE 
LOCAL POPULATION.  HE STATED THAT IT IS EXPECTED TO LAST SIX 
MONTHS LEAVING, HOWEVER, THE DOOR OPEN FOR A POSSIBLE 
EXTENSION.  HE REMARKED THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR A 
PARLIAMENTARY VOTE AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THE MISSION HAD 
ALREADY BEEN AUTHORIZED BY PARLIAMENT IN ITS APRIL 15 VOTE, 
BUT SAID PARLIAMENT WILL HAVE TO APPROVE FUNDING.  THE GOI IS 
PROVIDING IMMEDIATE FUNDING THROUGH A DECREE LAW THAT WILL 
SOON BE PRESENTED TO PARLIAMENT FOR ITS DISCUSSION AND FINAL 
APPROVAL.  MARTINO DID NOT INDICATE WHEN THE GOI WOULD 
PRESENT THE DECREE, BUT SAID IT WILL INCLUDE CIVIL 
RECONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING COORDINATED BY THE 
MFA. (NOTE: UNDER ITALY,S CONSTITUTION, DECREE LAWS ARE 
TOOLS FOR URGENT MATTERS; THEY ARE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AND 
VALID FOR 60 DAYS.  PARLIAMENT HAS 60 DAYS TO DISCUSS, AMEND 
AND APPROVE A DECREE LAW OR IT EXPIRES.  TO THE BEST OF OUR 
KNOWLEDGE, THIS NEVER HAPPENS WITH DECREES INVOLVING FUNDING 
FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE MISSIONS. END NOTE.) 
 
ITALIANS WITH THE BRITISH; WHO COMMANDS? 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶3.  MARTINO TOLD PARLIAMENT THAT ITALY'S AREA OF 
RESPONSIBILITY WILL BE IN THE SOUTHERN BRITISH SECTOR.  THE 
ITALIAN COMMANDER, WHO WILL BE BASED IN BASRA AT THE BRITISH 
DIVISIONAL COMMAND, WILL ENSURE THAT ITALIAN TROOPS ARE USED 
EXCLUSIVELY TO IMPLEMENT THE ASSIGNED MISSION APPROVED BY THE 
ITALIAN GOVERNMENT, WHICH WILL HAVE DISCRETION TO CHOOSE 
EXCEPTIONS OR DIFFERENT USES.  HE SAID THE TROOPS WILL BE 
SUBJECT TO THE ITALIAN MILITARY CODE OF WAR AS IT WAS 
RECENTLY AMENDED AND ASSURED PARLIAMENT THAT THEY WILL 
EXERCISE THE LOWEST POSSIBLE USE OF FORCE, IN COMPLIANCE WITH 
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ITALIAN LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  THE 
TROOPS WILL BE UNDER THE OPERATIONAL COMMAND OF THE ITALIAN 
CHIEF OF DEFENSE STAFF, "BUT THE BRITISH DIVISIONAL COMMAND 
HEADQUARTERED IN BASRA WILL HAVE OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL CONTINGENTS, INCLUDING THE ITALIANS, IN THE 
ENTIRE SOUTHERN SECTOR." 
 
MARTINO EXPLAINS TASKS... 
------------------------- 
 
¶4.  MARTINO CONFIRMED FM FRATTINI,S APRIL 15 STATEMENTS TO 
PARLIAMENT, NOTING THAT THE ITALIAN CONTINGENT WILL BE TASKED 
WITH CREATING AND MAINTAINING A SECURE ENVIRONMENT, 
CONTRIBUTING TO PUBLIC ORDER AND MILITARY POLICE UNITS, 
SUPPORTING DEMINING ACTIVITIES, DETECTING BIOLOGICAL AND 
CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES, PROVIDING HEALTH ASSISTANCE, PROVIDING 
AIRPORT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES, SUPPORTING OHRA ACTIVITIES, 
AND RESTORING INFRASTRUCTURE.  THE TROOPS WILL HAVE TO ENGAGE 
IN RECONNAISSANCE MISSIONS AND PATROLS, BUT THEIR PRESENCE ON 
THE GROUND "WILL BE AS DISCREET AS POSSIBLE" AND THE 
"INTERVENTION AND IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO POSSIBLE SITUATIONS 
OF DANGER WILL BE GUIDED BY THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND 
WILL BE BASED ON THE CONTINGENT'S HIGH MOBILITY, FLEXIBILITY, 
AND DYNAMISM, AS WELL AS ON HELICOPTERS."
