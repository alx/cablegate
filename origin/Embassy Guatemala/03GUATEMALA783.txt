¶1. (SBU) Polcouns delivered talking points (reftels) on the 
USG's intention to rejoin UNESCO and our candidacy for the 
Executive Board to the MFA Director General for Multilateral 
Affairs Giovanni Castillo on March 25.  Castillo said that 
Guatemala welcomed the USG decision to rejoin UNESCO, and 
said that the GOG could understand the USG's interest in 
being on the Executive Board in view of the substantial 
financial contribution the USG would be making to UNESCO's 
budget.  He promised to inform us as soon as the GOG has a 
position on the U.S. candidacy. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Castillo also informed us that the GOG is 
considering proposing a candidate for the UNESCO Executive 
Board, current Minister of Culture Otilia Lux.
