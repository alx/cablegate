REF: STATE 303844 
 
Due to a local holiday, we delivered reftel demarche to Luis 
Carranza, Acting Director for Multilateral Affairs at the 
Foreign Ministry on November 3.  Carranza was aware of the 
Fourth Committee vote, scheduled for November 7, and welcomed 
our draft resolution as he is currently putting together 
position papers.  Carranza said that Guatemala agrees in 
principle with our efforts to streamline and revitalize the 
UNGA, but had not yet made a decision about co-sponsoring the 
consolidated UNRWA resolution.
