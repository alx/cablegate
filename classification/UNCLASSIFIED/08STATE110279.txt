neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the 
relations among States in the region, 
 
Stressing again its firm commitment to the cause of peace 
throughout Sudan, full implementation of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 9 January 2005, full 
implementation of the framework agreed between the parties

Reiterating the importance of promoting a political

constructively in the process and to cooperate with AU/UN 
Chief Mediator Djibril Bassole, 
 
Reiterating its belief in the basis provided by the

sustained security in Darfur, deploring that the

Noting with strong concern the ongoing violence, 
impunity, and consequent deterioration of the humanitarian

about humanitarian access to populations in need, and 
calling upon all parties in Darfur to cease offensive 
actions immediately and to refrain from further violent 
attacks, 
 
Demanding that there should be no aerial bombings nor the

Commending the efforts of, and reiterating its full 
support for the African Union, the UN Secretary-General,

towards reducing violations by all parties of the
