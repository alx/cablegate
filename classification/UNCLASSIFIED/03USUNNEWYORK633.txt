SUBJECT: UN/IRAQ:SECRETARY-GENERAL ANNAN QUESTIONS 
LEGITIMACY OF ACTION WITHOUT UNSCR 
 
¶1. (U) SECRETARY-GENERAL ANNAN, IN THE HAGUE MARCH 10 FOR 
CYPRUS UNIFICATION TALKS, ADDRESSED THE PRESS ON IRAQ.  WHEN 
ASKED IF AN ATTACK ON IRAQ WITHOUT SECURITY COUNCIL 
AUTHORIZATION WOULD VIOLATE THE UN CHARTER, ANNAN SAID "IF 
THE U.S. AND OTHERS WERE TO GO OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL AND TAKE 
MILITARY ACTION, IT WOULD NOT BE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE 
CHARTER." ANNAN SAID PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD WANT A PEACEFUL 
RESOLUTION TO THE IRAQ CRISIS, AND EMPHASIZED THAT "WAR MUST 
ALWAYS BE A LAST RESORT." HE NOTED THAT THE UN HAS "A DUTY TO 
SEARCH UNTIL THE VERY END FOR THE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF 
CONFLICTS." 
 
¶2. (U) ANNAN NOTED THAT THE SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS "NOW 
FACE A MOMENTOUS CHOICE," ADDING, "IF THEY FAIL TO AGREE ON A 
COMMON POSITION, AND ACTION IS TAKEN WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY OF 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL, THE LEGITIMACY AND SUPPORT FOR ANY SUCH 
ACTION WILL BE SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED."  HE CONTINUED, ADDING 
THAT THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
WOULD CRUCIALLY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO DEAL WITH OTHER 
PROBLEMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND AFRICA. 
 ANNAN ALSO NOTED THE IMPORTANCE ATTACHED THE WORLD OVER TO 
THE SECURITY COUNCIL AND THE UN, AND SAID, "AS THEY APPROACH 
THEIR GRAVE DECISION, I MUST SOLEMNLY URGE ALL MEMBERS OF THE 
COUNCIL TO KEEP THIS IN MIND, AND TO BE WORTHY OF THE TRUST 
IN THEM THAT THE WORLD'S PEOPLE HAVE SHOWN." 
 
¶3. (U) HIS REMARKS WERE DISTRIBUTED BY UN NEW YORK'S PRESS 
SPOKESMAN.
