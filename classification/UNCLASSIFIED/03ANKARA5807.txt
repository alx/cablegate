¶1. (U) The Israeli Embassy in Ankara shared with us an 
unclassified facsimile copy of a letter sent September 5 from 
 
SIPDIS 
Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul to Israeli Foreign 
Minister Sylvan Shalom.  In the letter, Gul expresses concern 
over: 
 
 
-- the "formidable task" facing the Coalition in Iraq; 
-- the "stalled" Middle East peace process; 
-- recent terrorist attacks against Israel; 
-- resumption of unilateral visits to the al-Haram ash-Sharif 
by non-Muslims. 
 
 
Gul concludes the letter by saying that he looks forward to 
visiting Israel "at an opportune moment soon." 
 
 
¶2.  (U) Embassy Ankara is transmitting an unclassified 
facsimile copy of Gul's letter to the Turkey desk.
