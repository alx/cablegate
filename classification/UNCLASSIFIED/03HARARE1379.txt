  ¶1.   Mainstream newspapers have started dedicating acres of 
      editorial space to mull over United States President George 
      ¶W. Bush's visit to Africa.  Editorial excerpts follow: 
 
  ¶2.   Under headline "The Bush African trail" the 
      independent weekly "The Daily News on Sunday" (06/29) 
      comments: 
 
      ". . .George W. Bush. . .who begins an historic 
      journey through a changing Africa next month, has an 
      opportunity to join that pantheon of conservative 
      statesmen, by engaging the leaders in a dialogue for 
      a change in their priorities. . .Understandably, 
      Bush is not visiting Zimbabwe, because President 
      Robert Mugabe is (an) old man who refuses to open 
      his eyes to the reality of his country.  Politically 
      and economically, he is bereft of new ideas to 
      rescue his country from certain disaster.  He should 
      step aside to let younger people with 21st century 
      ideas take over.  Bush must convince South Africa's 
      President Thabo Mbeki that Mugabe must step down if 
      the regime change in Zimbabwe is to be without 
      bloodshed." 
 
  ¶3.   Under headline "African leaders must ignore Bush's 
      antics" the government-controlled weekly "The Sunday 
      Mail" (06/29) comments: 
 
      "The American President, George W. Bush, has grown 
      so arrogant that he is now giving deadlines on when 
      governments should be set up or deposed, ahead of 
      his African visit.  The contempt he is showing for 
      African leadership is as sickening as his attitude 
      towards the leadership of the people of Afghanistan 
      and Iraq. . .On what pedestal is he standing?  In 
      fact, he speaks with an air of a god.  It was clear 
      that the weapons of mass destruction that his 
      country possesses have deluded him into believing 
      that he is now a divine being who can speak and it 
      will (be) done.  He sees himself as Almighty God. . 
      .No wonder the revered former South African 
      president, Nelson Mandela, once remarked that the 
      Texan `cannot think properly' anymore.  We welcome 
      the stance that Mr. Mandela has taken in advance of 
      Bush's visit that the Texan should be met with a 
      clear message of how appalled Africans are by the 
      murderous policies of the Bush and Blair 
      administrations.  African leaders across the 
      continent must stand firm and refuse to be 
      patronized. . .Bush is a war-monger and not a 
      peacemaker and must be made to feel like 
      one. . .Zimbabwe and Africa should simply ignore 
      Colin Powell and Bush and look inside and among 
      themselves for solutions to the challenges that 
      beset them."
