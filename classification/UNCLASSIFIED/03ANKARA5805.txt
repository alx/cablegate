BRIEFING 
 
 
Iraqi Interim Government Members in Ankara:  Papers report 
that representatives of the Iraqi interim government, headed 
by Ahmet Chalabi, arrived in Ankara yesterday.  Following 
his meeting at the Foreign Ministry, Chalabi was asked 
whether or not he wants to see Turkish troops in Iraq. 
Chalabi responded by saying that his previous negative 
comments on the issue reflected his `personal opinion,' 
which did not necessarily reflect the view of the interim 
government.  Chalabi said that the US, not the Council, has 
the authority to decide on this issue.  According to 
"Zaman,"  Chalabi said that the interim government's 
responsibility is not to invite troops but to ensure the 
sovereignty of the Iraqi people.  "NTV" reported Chalabi as 
saying that "the Turkish Government has given us a guarantee 
that Turkish troops will not be sent unless Iraq wants 
them." 
 
 
PM Erdogan Postpones Visit to Iran:  "Cumhuriyet" reports 
that PM Erdogan has postponed a visit to Iran that had been 
scheduled for late September.  The paper notes that the 
reason for this decision was Iran's refusal to undertake any 
action against the PKK/KADEK. 
 
 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION: 9/11: Second Anniversary 
 
 
"Not only a US responsibility" 
Sami Kohen wrote in mass appeal Milliyet (9/12): "During the 
last two years, global terrorism has increased despite the 
US declared war against terrorism.  The world is no longer a 
secure place, and remains subject to the threat of 
terrorism.  Al Qaeda is still operating, and Usama Bin-Ladin 
is still alive.  The US is living under the threat of a new 
9/11.  . It is true that the policies shaped by the Bush 
administration are one of the main reasons for this negative 
picture.  However, this alone should not make us forget an 
important reality: Terrorism is a big and serious threat not 
only to the US but also to the rest of the world. . At this 
stage, the whole world should feel responsible for dealing 
with the terrorism problem by implementing effective and 
timely measures against it.  Terrorism is an enemy of the 
whole world, and we never know where and when it will 
strike. The fight against terrorism is such a vital issue 
that it should not be left to the US to deal with it alone." 
 
 
"September 11: Two Years Later" 
Haluk Ulman wrote in the economic-political Dunya (9/12): 
"Two years later, the picture we now have does not provide 
much room for optimism.  The Bush administration began its 
campaign by arguing that it could eliminate international 
terrorism and make the world a more secure place to live. 
Yet the campaign has been conducted against the rest of the 
world, and these unilateral policies of the US have not 
produced any results.  The current situation in both Iraq 
and Afghanistan, which hints at a broader wave of terrorism, 
is enough reason to be pessimistic. . Moreover, the 
allegation about Iraq's link with international terrorism 
has not been proved, but Iraq has now been turned into an 
operational base for terrorists following the US invasion. . 
One of the most valuable gains after 9/11 could have been 
the formation of a US-led international coalition against 
terrorism.  However, the Bush administration has not used 
this chance  -- in fact, it has squandered it."
