¶1. On October 12, econchief called Ministry of Finance 
Assistant Undersecretary for Revenue and Budget Khalid Al- 
Bustani to confirm that the UAE Minister of Finance had 
received the Spanish invitation and to urge a concerted UAEG 
effort to recruit a high-level private sector delegation to 
travel to the Madrid meeting.  Al-Bustani confirmed that the 
Minister had received the invitation and said that he was 
coordinating with the MFA and the UAE Federation of Chambers 
of Commerce on the delegation.  He told econchief that he 
was communicating with Said bin Jaber Al-Suweidi, the 
Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and of the UAE 
Federation of Chambers of Commerce about trying to recruit 
an appropriate delegation.  Al-Bustani stressed that the UAE 
fully supported its private sector and the idea of private 
sector involvement in Iraqi reconstruction. 
 
¶2. Charge and econchief met with Assistant Undersecretary 
for Political Affairs Abdullah Rashid Al-Nuami on October 14 
and urged him to recruit an appropriate high level private 
sector delegation to travel to the Madrid meeting.  Al-Nuami 
confirmed that the UAE was working on a private sector 
delegation and that it would be coordinated through the 
Federation of Chambers of Commerce. 
 
¶3. Comment:  The UAE is very interested in investment 
opportunities in Iraq.  Based on this interest, we believe 
that the UAEG will have few problems recruiting an 
appropriately high-level private sector delegation for the 
meeting.  End Comment.
