SUBJECT: COTE D'IVOIRE: PRESIDENTIAL STATEMENT 
 
 ¶1. (U) USUN may support adoption of the French-drafted 
Presidential Statement on Cote d'Ivoire.  The text is in 
paragraph 2 below. 
 
¶2.  (U) Begin text: 
 
(1) The Security Council welcomes the communique dated 18 May 
2009 of the Permanent Consultative Framework of the 
Ouagadougou Political Agreement, which provides a 
comprehensive electoral timeframe leading to the first round 
of the presidential election in Cote d'Ivoire on 29 November 
¶2009. It stresses that this timeframe has been endorsed by 
all the main Ivorian political actors, as requested by the 
statement of the President of the Security Council 
S/PRST/2008/42 and resolution 1865 (2009). 
(2) The Security Council underlines the importance of the 
effective implementation of each of the five stages leading 
to the elections, as referred to in the report of the 
Secretary-General dated 13 April 2009 (S/2009/196), namely: 
(l) the publication of the provisional voters list at the end 
of voter registration operations, (2) the publication of the 
final voters' list, (3) the production of identification and 
voters cards, (4) the distribution of identification and 
voters cards and (5) the electoral campaigning period. 
(3) The Security Council, consistent with its resolution 1865 
(2009) underlines that this timeline binds the Ivorian 
political actors and that the way it will be implemented will 
reflect their level of political commitment towards the 
holding of free, fair, open and transparent elections in a 
secure environment. The Security Council urges the Ivorian 
political actors to meet their commitments in full and 
without further delay. It urges again the political actors in 
particular to comply fully with the Code of Good Conduct for 
elections they signed under the auspices of the 
Secretary-General on 23 April 2008. 
(4) The Security Council reaffirms its full support to the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Cote 
d'Ivoire and to the United Nations Operation in Cote 
d'Ivoire, and recalls that the Special Representative shall 
certify that all stages of the electoral process provide all 
the necessary guarantees for the holding of free, fair, open 
and transparent presidential and legislative elections in 
accordance with international standards, consistent with 
paragraph 20 of Resolution 1865 (2009). It takes note of the 
request by the Ivorian parties that the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General make known and 
explain to all Ivorian stakeholders the content and modus 
operandi of the five-criteria framework referred to in 
document S/2008/250 and in resolution 1865 (2009). 
(5) The Security Council reiterates its full support for the 
Facilitator, and calls on the Ivorian political actors to 
continue to cooperate fully with him, in particular in this 
critical phase of the peace process. 
(6) The Security Council expresses the hope that the 
announcement of the electoral timeframe will give a new 
impetus to the implementation of the Ouagadougou Political 
agreement and its Supplementary Agreements.   It takes note 
positively of the ceremony of transfer of authority held in 
Bouake on the 26 of May 2009 and urges the Ivorian parties to 
continue to make progress. 
(7) The Security Council reiterates its determination to 
bring its full support to a credible electoral process in 
Cote d'Ivoire. To this end, it requests the Secretary-General 
to keep it closely and regularly informed of the progress 
made by the parties in the implementation of each of the key 
stages of the electoral timeframe.
