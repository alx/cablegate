SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION SECRETARY POWELL'S OP-ED ON ZIM 
UNDER FIRE; HARARE 
 
  ¶1.   The government-controlled daily "The Herald" continues 
      to publish discourteous articles against Secretary of State 
      Colin Powell.  Excerpts of an 
      op-ed carried in the July 2 edition follow: 
 
  ¶2.   Under headline "U. S. Secretary of State ignorant of 
      Zimbabwean situation" the "Herald" (07/02) carried 
      the following op-ed by Willmore Kanyongo - based in 
      the United States - on page 4: 
 
      "It is clear the U. S. Secretary of State - Colin 
      Powell - is totally ignorant of the Zimbabwean 
      situation.  The article he wrote. . .has further 
      shown him as a shameless liar, who habitually sought 
      to build his foreign policy on utter fabrication. . 
      .American foreign policy has always been underpinned 
      by double talk, double standards, deception and 
      false promises of money if certain leaders are 
      removed. . .Zimbabweans should be wary and not 
      succumb to these American machinations."
