ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
¶8.  Radikal: The President of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry of Diyarbakir, Kutbettin 
Arzu, said the economy in the region has been in 
an extremely difficult situation since September 
2001 because trade from the Habur Border gate 
with Iraq ended. Everybody is hoping that the 
border trade would start again. Arzu claimed that 
opening the border trade would cause a boom in 
production and revive many sectors. With 
conclusion of the war, people, hopeful trade will 
resume, have been trying to buy trucks from all 
parts of Turkey. The prices for trucks in the 
region have increased between USD 6,500 and USD 
13,000. Bedrettin Karaboga, the President of 
GUNSIAD -Southeastern Industrialists and 
Businessmen Association-, also expressed that 
Habur Border Gate was vital for the economy of 
the region. Karaboga mentioned the border trade 
would also play a great role in the rebuilding of 
Iraq in addition to the UN contracts. Karaboga 
claimed Iran exported a large quantity of goods 
to Iraq and Syria sent many trucks of TV-dishes 
that had been banned in Iraq for 15 years. 
Karaboga added that the Habur Border Gate had 
been closed since September 11, 2001, for 
security considerations. Approximately three 
hundred thousand people were hurt from the 
closure of the gate.
