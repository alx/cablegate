¶1. THE FOLLOWING TEXT IS A TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
REMARKS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MAY BE USED AS TALKING 
POINTS WHEN DISCUSSING THE MILITARY ACTION IN IRAQ THAT 
BEGAN 19 MARCH 2003. 
 
¶2. BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: THE PRESIDENT:  MY FELLOW CITIZENS, 
AT THIS HOUR, AMERICAN AND COALITION FORCES ARE IN THE 
EARLY STAGES OF MILITARY OPERATIONS TO DISARM IRAQ, TO 
FREE ITS PEOPLE AND TO DEFEND THE WORLD FROM GRAVE DANGER. 
 
ON MY ORDERS, COALITION FORCES HAVE BEGUN STRIKING 
SELECTED TARGETS OF MILITARY IMPORTANCE TO UNDERMINE 
SADDAM HUSSEIN'S ABILITY TO WAGE WAR.  THESE ARE OPENING 
STAGES OF WHAT WILL BE A BROAD AND CONCERTED CAMPAIGN. 
MORE THAN 35 COUNTRIES ARE GIVING CRUCIAL SUPPORT  -- 
FROM THE USE OF NAVAL AND AIR BASES, TO HELP WITH 
INTELLIGENCE AND LOGISTICS, TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF COMBAT 
UNITS.  EVERY NATION IN THIS COALITION HAS CHOSEN TO BEAR 
THE DUTY AND SHARE THE HONOR OF SERVING IN OUR COMMON 
DEFENSE. 
 
TO ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES 
NOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE PEACE OF A TROUBLED WORLD AND 
THE HOPES OF AN OPPRESSED PEOPLE NOW DEPEND ON YOU.  THAT 
TRUST IS WELL PLACED. 
 
THE ENEMIES YOU CONFRONT WILL COME TO KNOW YOUR SKILL AND 
BRAVERY.  THE PEOPLE YOU LIBERATE WILL WITNESS THE 
HONORABLE AND DECENT SPIRIT OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY.  IN 
THIS CONFLICT, AMERICA FACES AN ENEMY WHO HAS NO REGARD 
FOR CONVENTIONS OF WAR OR RULES OF MORALITY.  SADDAM 
HUSSEIN HAS PLACED IRAQI TROOPS AND EQUIPMENT IN CIVILIAN 
AREAS, ATTEMPTING TO USE INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN 
AS SHIELDS FOR HIS OWN MILITARY  --  A FINAL ATROCITY 
AGAINST HIS PEOPLE. 
 
I WANT AMERICANS AND ALL THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT COALITION 
FORCES WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SPARE INNOCENT CIVILIANS 
FROM HARM.  A CAMPAIGN ON THE HARSH TERRAIN OF A NATION AS 
LARGE AS CALIFORNIA COULD BE LONGER AND MORE DIFFICULT 
THAN SOME PREDICT.  AND HELPING IRAQIS ACHIEVE A UNITED, 
STABLE AND FREE COUNTRY WILL REQUIRE OUR SUSTAINED 
COMMITMENT. 
 
WE COME TO IRAQ WITH RESPECT FOR ITS CITIZENS, FOR THEIR 
GREAT CIVILIZATION AND FOR THE RELIGIOUS FAITHS THEY 
PRACTICE.  WE HAVE NO AMBITION IN IRAQ, EXCEPT TO REMOVE A 
THREAT AND RESTORE CONTROL OF THAT COUNTRY TO ITS OWN 
PEOPLE. 
 
I KNOW THAT THE FAMILIES OF OUR MILITARY ARE PRAYING THAT 
ALL THOSE WHO SERVE WILL RETURN SAFELY AND SOON.  MILLIONS 
OF AMERICANS ARE PRAYING WITH YOU FOR THE SAFETY OF YOUR 
LOVED ONES AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE INNOCENT.  FOR 
YOUR SACRIFICE, YOU HAVE THE GRATITUDE AND RESPECT OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE.  AND YOU CAN KNOW THAT OUR FORCES WILL BE 
COMING HOME AS SOON AS THEIR WORK IS DONE. 
 
OUR NATION ENTERS THIS CONFLICT RELUCTANTLY  --  YET, OUR 
PURPOSE IS SURE.  THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND OUR 
FRIENDS AND ALLIES WILL NOT LIVE AT THE MERCY OF AN OUTLAW 
REGIME THAT THREATENS THE PEACE WITH WEAPONS OF MASS 
MURDER. WE WILL MEET THAT THREAT NOW, WITH OUR ARMY, AIR 
FORCE, NAVY, COAST GUARD AND MARINES, SO THAT WE DO NOT 
HAVE TO MEET IT LATER WITH ARMIES OF FIRE FIGHTERS AND 
POLICE AND DOCTORS ON THE STREETS OF OUR CITIES. 
 
NOW THAT CONFLICT HAS COME, THE ONLY WAY TO LIMIT ITS 
DURATION IS TO APPLY DECISIVE FORCE.  AND I ASSURE YOU, 
THIS WILL NOT BE A CAMPAIGN OF HALF MEASURES, AND WE WILL 
ACCEPT NO OUTCOME BUT VICTORY. 
 
MY FELLOW CITIZENS, THE DANGERS TO OUR COUNTRY AND THE 
WORLD WILL BE OVERCOME.  WE WILL PASS THROUGH THIS TIME OF 
PERIL AND CARRY ON THE WORK OF PEACE.  WE WILL DEFEND OUR 
FREEDOM.  WE WILL BRING FREEDOM TO OTHERS AND WE WILL 
PREVAIL. 
 
MAY GOD BLESS OUR COUNTRY AND ALL WHO DEFEND HER.  END 
TRANSCRIPT.
