SUBJECT: CANADA SUPPORTS U.S. POSITIONS FOR WORLD 
RADIOCOMMUNICATION CONFERENCE 
 
REF: STATE 146062 
 
¶1. Canada will support U.S positions on Agenda items 1.5 and 
1.24 at the World Radiocommunication Conference.  According 
to Industry Canada's Director for Terrestrial Engineering 
Doug Sward, Canada has been on board with these two issues 
throughout their preparations for the Conference.  Sward will 
join Industry Canada's Director General for Spectrum Engineer 
Bob McCaughern, who is already in Geneva, at the WRC. 
 
¶2. Despite their support, Sward stated that the GOC did not 
agree with the U.S. suggestion that technical and operating 
restrictions on the mobile devices used in wireless access 
systems proposed in Agenda item 1.5 would protect radar 
operations and systems in the earth exploration satellite 
service.  A Canadian study, which is supported by results 
from the EU, indicates that the restrictions would protect 
air, maritime and ground-based radar, but would only 
mitigate, and not fully protect, radar systems in the earth 
exploration satellite services.  Sward noted that this was 
not a major point since other criteria will protect earth 
exploration satellites, but one that he thought deserved 
clarification.
