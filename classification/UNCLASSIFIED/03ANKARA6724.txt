PolMilOff delivered reftel demarche on improving the 
operation of the UNGA First Committee to MFA Disarmament Head 
of Department Bulent Meric October 22.  On October 24, Meric 
gave PolMilOff a "preliminary reaction," saying the text of 
resolution "looked fine."  However, after having checked with 
the Turkish mission in New York, Meric learned that no 
consensus had yet emerged because the Non-Aligned Movement 
(NAM) had numerous questionable amendment proposals. 
According to the Turkish UN mission, if the NAM continued 
with its "killer amendments" the US intended to withdraw its 
support for the resolution.  So as not to be left in the 
embarrassing position of co-sponsoring the resolution after 
the US withdrew its support, Turkey was waiting to see how 
the resolution would look in the end.  But, in general, Meric 
said Turkey's views on the issue were in line with 
Washington's.
