Information Minister Jonathan Moyo has vowed to silence 
Studio 7, a Voice of America (VOA) news program on 
Zimbabwe.  Delivering a speech at the launch of New ZIANA, 
a multi-media state organization charged with publishing 
pro-government and ZANU PF information, last week, Moyo is 
quoted as saying "Studio 7 will die.  It faces death.  They 
think we are sleeping, we want to see where they are going 
with Studio 7."
