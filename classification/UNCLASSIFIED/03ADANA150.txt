the students had brought in order to sell. Three 
students were wounded as they tried to prevent a

ECONOMIC AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 
¶7.  Sabah: As the peshmergain Northern Iraq 
increased the dinar's rate of exchange against 
the USD arbitrarily, truckers carrying goods from 
Turkey to Iraq went on a strike for three days. 
The truckers started carrying goods to Iraq again 
only after the authorities resolved the issue. 
The ROE was 20 Iraqi dinars to USD 1.00 until a 
week ago, but because of a vacuum of authority, 
the peshmerga charged 3.50 Iraqi dinars to USD 
1.00. As a result of the arbitrary application, 
the Iraqis increased the transit fee to 120 US 
dollars. After the truckers' strike, the transit 
fee was dropped to 20 US dollars. Sirnak Deputy 
Governor Resul Celik said only Turkish truckers 
passing from Habur border gate were exposed to 
such an application which aimed to make the trade 
from Turkey difficult.
