Responding to our dipnote sent to MFA on May 7 advising of 
the availability of a second tranche of anthrax vaccines, MFA 
sent a dipnote dated May 16 stating that "our authorities 
have concluded that the original offer of 10,000 doses of 
vaccines would be sufficient to meet our requirements and 
consequently, a second purchase of additional vaccines is not 
necessary."
