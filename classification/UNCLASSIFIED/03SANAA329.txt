maker. Participants enjoyed the study case immensely as it 
touched on the most important issue women face when 
participating in politics, which is the resistance women 
face and the limited social settings for women to express 
and participate with men in discussion and decision-making. 
 
¶8. (U) Outcome: Strengths 
 
      Workshops reached 300 women in five governorates and 
     received attention from officials and civil society. 
    Some of the speakers were women local council members 
which gave participants opportunity to listen to their 
experiences and get first hand information of women's 
experience in the public and political life. 
    Several district local council members in each 
governorate attended the workshop and benefited from the 
subjects presented and the discussions. 
    Participants' evaluations of the workshops were very 
positive. Participants acknowledged their dire need to these 
workshops at the governorate levels and the knowledge they 
gain from them as they touch upon very important and current 
women issues. 
    Participation of officials in the workshops showed the 
government's support for women empowerment and development. 
    WIDA's capacity and efficiency in conducting the 
program in five governorates was evident in the 
participants' evaluation of the workshops, media coverage 
and visual and written documentation of the program. 
 
¶9. (U) Outcome: Weaknesses 
 
      In Taiz governorate, the workshop faced resistance from 
     some officials. However, the workshop was well received 
     among the community. 
    In Lahaj, the general secretary was assigned to present 
a paper. But the paper was presented by someone else which 
made discussion of paper subject useless since the general 
secretary was not present to respond. 
 
SIPDIS 
    In Mahweet, participants were less outspoken as the 
area is still conservative and requires more awareness 
programs and advocacy in regards to women participation.
