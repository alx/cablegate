REF: STATE 321138 
 
¶1.  This is an action request. 
 
¶2.  During his consultations with the Dutch, EUR Principal 
Deputy Assistant Secretary Charlie Ries raised reftel points 
with MFA deputy Political Director Herman Schaper.  Schaper 
said that the Dutch are interested in having Max van der 
Stoel, former UN rapporteur in Iraq, help the IGC draft the 
"fundamental law." Van der Stoel not only knows Iraq well, 
but also is experienced at helping multi-ethnic countries 
draft new laws from his years as OSCE High Representative for 
National Minorities.  Van der Stoel wants to help in Iraq, 
and has visited in the past few months.  Iraqi Governing 
Council members have expressed general interest, but the IGC 
has not yet formally asked for his assistance.  Schaper asked 
whether the U.S. saw value in this offer.  He made clear that 
an invitation would have to come from the IGC.  Please advise. 
 
¶3.  PDAS Ries cleared this message.
