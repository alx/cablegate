¶1. (SBU/NF) ESTHOff delivered reftel to relevant contacts in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and UK Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) on October 15.  Steve Walsgrove, Assistant Director of the Nuclear Unit at DECC, told ESTHOff on October 16 that HMG is "joined up" with the United States on the proposed International Nuclear Energy Framework (INEF).  Walsgrove said HMG supports simplifying the Statement of Principles of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) and replacing it with the mission statement suggested for the INEF.  The INEF appears to be a more "inclusive" way forward, he added, to address issues concerning the nuclear fuel cycle.  FCO Nuclear Issues Team Leader Nick Low told ESTHOff he defers to DECC, which has the lead on the GNEP/INEF issue.  

¶2. (SBU/NF) Walsgrove told ESTHOff that Secretary of DECC Ed Miliband is unable to attend the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) Executive Committee Meeting in Beijing October 23.  Mel Draper, Director of the Nuclear Unit at DECC, will lead the delegation, along with Steve Walsgrove, representing HMG.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
