¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: In recent conversations with CEO Forum Brazilian 
co-chair Josue Gomes da Silva, Presidente of Coteminas, prioritized 
infrastructure investment, private equity, and venture capital as 
Forum topics, emphasized interest in Brazilian access to Haiti HOPE 
II, welcomed energy cooperation in the CEO Forum, and suggested the 
CEOs could address the on-going WTO cotton dispute.  Gomes da Silva 
would like to invite Director of the National Economic Council 
Summers, Treasury Secretary Geithner, and Energy Secretary Chu and 
Brazilian Energy Minister Lobao to participate in the Forum. At the 
Ambassador's request, Gomes da Silva will explore if language 
referencing the F18 procurement could be included in the Forum 
statement.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In recent meetings with the Ambassador, CEO Forum 
Brazilian co-chair Josue Gomes da Silva indicated that the CEOs will 
emphasize infrastructure investment, private equity and venture 
capital on the Forum agenda.  Gomes da Silva urged progress on GOB 
requests for Brazilian participation in Hope II as a way to foster 
development in Haiti. He hoped the CEO Forum could explore potential 
solutions to the WTO cotton dispute that would focus on tariffs on 
goods, rather than on cross-retaliation on intellectual property 
rights as has been proposed in the Brazilian Congress as an option 
for MRE to exercise.  He intends to keep visa issues and increased 
airline frequencies on the Forum agenda.  Gomes da Silva was 
enthusiastic about incorporating energy into the CEO Forum.  He 
agreed with the Ambassador that expanding Forum membership to 
include an eleventh company focused on energy issues should be 
explored. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Gomes da Silva would like Secretary Chu and Brazilian 
Energy Minister to speak to the Forum during the working part of the 
agenda.  If available, Gomes da Silva hopes NEC Director Summers 
could address the Forum during the working session or attend the 
dinner.  Gomes da Silva would also like to invite Treasury Secretary 
Geitner to the Forum dinner. He hopes the CEOs will be able to 
present their recommendation document to POTUS at the end of the 
Forum, but emphasized the CEOs would be pleased with POTUS 
participation wherever his schedule could permit. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) At the Ambassador's request, Gomes da Silva engaged to 
explore whether Brazilian CEOs could support a statement on the 
pending F18 procurement.  While Gomes da Silva felt any reference to 
"military" would be difficult, he thought a reference to increasing 
economic integration and a "sale between governments" might be 
possible to gain agreement to include. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Gomes da Silva hopes to have a draft working agenda in the 
next few weeks to share.
