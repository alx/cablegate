¶1. (SBU) The following responses are keyed to Department 
queries (reftel): 

A: Description of Chinese engagement in Angola: The Chinese are 
heavily engaged in financing and implementing Angola's 
reconstruction following the end of the nation's devastating civil 
war in 2002. In the absence of a much anticipated (by the 
Angolans) conference of Western donors to help fund reconstruction, 
Angola turned to the Chinese. Chinese financing includes a (mostly 
oil-backed) USD 4 billion line of credit through the Chinese Ex-Im 
Bank. Although the terms of this line of credit are not entirely 
clear, it seemingly provides concessionary interest rates and some 
grace period for repayment. According to unconfirmed reports, an 
additional line of credit of up to USD 4 to 6 billion has been 
established through the Chinese Investment Fund (CIF), though Post 
doubts that this fund, which was to have been funded by Chinese 
investors, ever attracted enough Chinese capital to undertake 
intended infrastructure projects in Angola. At the moment, the CIF 
is partnering with state oil company Sonangol in extractive 
industry ventures in Africa outside of Angola. 

The Chinese Ex-Im Bank line of credit is linked to the use of 
Chinese companies as prime contractors for Chinese-funded projects. 
Many sub-contractors for these projects are Chinese companies as 
well. Some of these companies have stayed in Angola after project 
completion and are branching out into other areas, such as 
import/export transactions and private housing. The feverish pace 
of Chinese engagement in Angola cooled markedly in 2009 as the 
global financial crisis gutted Angola's oil and diamond revenues, 
precipitating sharp reductions in GRA expenditures. According to 
the Chinese Ambassador in Luanda, China had to recall more than 
25,000 workers in 2009 due to the lack of GRA funds to pay them. 
Few new projects were launched in 2009, though most of those 
previously underway continued, albeit often at a reduced pace. 
However, those linked to preparations for the January 2010 Africa 
Cup of Nations Football (soccer) Championship, which Angola hosted 
by building four new stadiums, continued full-steam. 

Recently concluded and currently underway infrastructure and 
energy sector-related undertakings include: 

---upgrading the electricity network in Luanda; 

---rehabilitation of Angola's three railway lines: Luanda-Malanje 
(completion in 2010); Namibe-Menongue (completion in 2011); and 
Benguela-DRC(completion in 2012); 

---improvements of infrastructure in Luanda, including building a 
new international airport; 

---numerous roads and highways outside of Luanda; 

---social housing projects within Luanda; 

---four football (soccer) stadiums (Luanda, Benguela, Lubango, and 
Cabinda) that were used during the Africa Cup of Nations tournament 
in January 2010; 

---joint oil exploration venture with Angolan parastatal Sonangol 
in Block 18; and 

---a diamond mining venture with state diamond company Endiama. 

¶B. Examples of U.S.-China cooperation in Angola. Chinese 
contractors have successfully implemented DOD-funded humanitarian 
assistance projects, and a Chinese national is engaged by an 
implementing partner in our malaria program. 

¶C. Potential areas for U.S.-China cooperation. As reported Ref B, 
the Ambassador raised with the Chinese Ambassador in July 2008 the 
concept of a joint agricultural development project, and the 
Chinese Ambassador agreed to explore the possibilities. However, 
determined efforts by USAID technical staff failed to identify a 
project consistent with our development objectives to which the 
Chinese could contribute meaningfully. Given shifts in FY-2010 
USAID funding, Post will undertake again to explore possibilities 
for cooperation with the Chinese in regard to either our expanding 
agriculture program or in our malaria and/or HIV/AIDS programs. 
Post experience has shown, however, that language can be a 
considerable barrier; for example, the current Chinese Ambassador 
speaks no Portuguese or English and only limited Spanish.

¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: The Chinese presence looms large in Angola. 
Although exact numbers are elusive, a minimum of 50,000 Chinese are 
in the country; most other estimates are markedly higher. Few 
question that the Chinese have contributed importantly to Angola's 
ongoing national reconstruction. Nonetheless, some Angolans 
express concerns that Chinese engagement, financed by loans that 
Angola needs to repay, has failed to create jobs for Angolans, has 
failed to transfer technology to Angolans, and has often resulted 
in poor quality performance. Concerns have also been raised about 
the opaque nature of the Chinese funding, which is channeled 
through the Office of National Reconstruction of the Presidency. 
END COMMENT.
