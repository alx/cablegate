SUBJECT: GOZ to seize equipment on resettled farms 
 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  The GOZ has taken fast track land reform 
to the next level, authorizing its agents to seize 
equipment such as tractors, sprinklers and ploughs from 
former commercial farmers.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Statutory Instrument 273A of 2003 allows the 
Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement to 
assign to any agent the responsibility to "enter any land 
or premises at any reasonable time" and "acquire any farm 
equipment or material not currently being used for 
agricultural purposes."  Since it has the effect of a 
Presidential decree, the GOZ may act upon it immediately, 
in advance of Parliamentary deliberation.  It calls for 
former commercial farmers who sell or damage their farm 
equipment to be fined or imprisoned.  While the 
instrument lays out a compensation timetable, it will be 
the responsibility of the Ministry to determine fair 
valuation. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  Efforts by former, mostly white 
farmers to stash farm equipment around the country have 
irritated the GOZ and some land reform beneficiaries. 
However, movable farm equipment and supplies (such as 
fertilizer) have remained the property of the ex-farmer, 
who retained the right to sell but not export these 
implements.  Some held on to equipment because they hoped 
to return to their land - others because they could not 
get what they considered a fair price due to the glut of 
equipment on the market.  This legislation will permit 
many beneficiaries to seize equipment, perhaps through 
force.  The GOZ has increasingly moved beyond the idea 
that land reform should be limited to redistribution of 
arable white farms.  Conservancies and certain businesses 
are also now included.  We expect the GOZ will establish 
very low values for seized equipment, applying the 
official exchange rate or an amount that does not reflect 
Zimbabwe's high inflation.
