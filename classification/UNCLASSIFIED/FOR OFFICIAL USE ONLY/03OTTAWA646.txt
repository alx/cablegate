(SBU) COL Geoff St. John, head of Foreign Affairs' 
Peacekeeping Section, told us on March 7 that Canada is very 
unlikely to be able to increase its contribution to MFO.  He 
said the Department of National Defense is staffing our 
request to see if it could fill any of the specific needs 
lifted in reftel, but that its pending contribution of a 
battalion and brigade headquarters to ISAF IV and V will put 
a huge strain on the Canadian Forces.
