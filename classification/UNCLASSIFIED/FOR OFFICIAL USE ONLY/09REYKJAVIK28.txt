¶1. (U) Summary:  After a week of negotiations, Iceland's Social 
Democratic Alliance and Left-Green Movement announced a minority 
government on February 1.  The new government, dependent upon the 
centrist Progressive Party for support, is headed by SDA Prime 
Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir, Iceland's first female PM.  The 
cabinet is gender-balanced and split equally between the two 
parties, with two ministers drawn from outside politics.    The 
leftist government will have roughly 80 days to implement its 
domestic- and economics-focused agenda before early parliamentary 
elections on April 25.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) One day after the collapse of the Independence Party (IP) 
and Social Democratic Alliance (SDA) coalition on January 26, 
Iceland's President asked the country's two leftist parties -- the 
SDA and the Left-Green Movement (LGM) to form a minority coalition 
with the support of the Progressive Party.  The SDA and LGM agreed 
quickly on the broad outlines of their cabinet and their desire to 
focus on domestic economic issues ahead of early elections at the 
end of April.  However, talks slowed down over Progressive Party 
(PP) demands that the economic plan be more detailed. 
 
¶3.  (U) On February 1, the SDA and the LGM announced the makeup of 
their minority coalition with the support of the PP.  Current seat 
allocations in the Althingi (parliament) mean that the SDA and LGM 
require nearly 100 percent support from the Progressives to pass 
legislation during the remainder of the legislative session.   There 
are 10 ministers in the cabinet, as opposed to 12 in the previous 
cabinet.  Notably, there are two non-party affiliated ministers: the 
Minister of Commerce and the Minister of Justice and Ecclesiastical 
Affairs.  Also of note is the absence of SDA Chair and previous 
Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir, who has announced she 
will take at least a month of medical leave to recover from 
treatment for a benign brain tumor.  Gisladottir remains SDA Chair, 
however, and says she has no plans to retire from politics. 
 
¶4.  (U) Returning ministers in the government are: Prime Minister 
Johanna Sigurdardottir (SDA, previously Minister of Social Welfare); 
Minister for Foreign Affairs and Industry Ossur Skarphedinsson (SDA, 
previously Minister of Industry); and Minister of Transport and 
Communications Kristjan Moller.  Biographical summaries of the new 
ministers follow.
