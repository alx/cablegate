SUBJECT: GENERALITAT TO OPEN OFFICIAL "DELEGATION" IN NEW YORK CITY 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY:  The Catalan regional government plans to open 
an official "delegation" in New York city as early as October 
30, 2009.  Housed in Rockefeller Center, the new offices will 
bring together the various Catalan entities in the city under 
one roof and will be coordinated by a representative from 
Catalonia.  In doing so, Generalitat officials hope to raise the 
Catalonia's profile in the United States and Canada, as well as 
with UN organizations.  Catalonia Vice President Josep 
Carod-Rovira is expected to travel to the U.S. to inaugurate the 
new office.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U)  Roser Clavell, Secretary General of Foreign Affairs told 
CG September 9 the Generalitat (Catalonia's regional government) 
plans to extend its presence abroad this year by opening offices 
in New York city.   According to Clavell, the new office will 
bring together under one roof the various offices the 
Generalitat has in the most prominent capital cities in the 
world.  Who will head the delegation has not yet been decided. 
The Generalitat currently has offices in Paris, Berlin, 
Brussels, and London.  There also plans to open offices in 
Buenos Aires and Mexico City, and Morocco.  Catalonia has a 
number of offices to promote tourism, business, and the Catalan 
culture and art. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Clavell lamented the fact that the world, in her words, 
only knows Catalonia through two ways, the diplomatic corps 
resident in Barcelona (good) and the national Spanish press (not 
so good).  Clavell implied the Generalitat was not happy with 
its portrayal in the press and wanted to tell its own story. 
The new offices are a way of doing just that.  The office in New 
York will be located at the Rockefeller Center and it is planned 
to be opened on October 30.  Clavell will accompany Generalitat 
VP and Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) President Josep 
Carod-Rovira  to New York for the inauguration.  While being 
there, Clavell said officials are hoping to meet with New York 
Governor Patterson, participate in the opening of an exhibit on 
Catalan painter Joan Miro organized by MOMA, and attend UNESCO's 
linguistic university. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Despite falling popularity at the polls, ERC 
leader Carod-Rovira is pressing ahead with his strategy of 
raising Catalonia's flag in the world's major cities.  While it 
is not at all clear Catalans are happy seeing their taxes go to 
expensive offices in the most expensive cities around the world, 
especially since officials have recently claimed lack of 
resources to cover rising social and educational programs, the 
ERC is hoping regional pride will eventually win the day.  One 
official close to Generalitat President Jose Montilla told CG 
recently the President has made the decision to systematically 
cut the Vice President's office out of foreign affairs.  This 
latest move by Carod-Rovira could be a reaction to the 
President.  Conversely, Carod's decision to open the New York 
office might have been the action that caused the President to 
decide to start clipping the Vice President's wings.  End 
Comment.
