¶3. (U) FM Marwan Muasher, in a 3/28 interview with the 
Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera (ref A), reiterated 
that "there have not been, there are not, and there will not 
be any attacks on Iraq from our territory or from our air 
space.  The rumors circulating in that sense are false." 
While acknowledging that U.S. soldiers are in the Kingdom 
manning Patriot missile batteries, and for logistics and 
defensive operations, Muasher stated "there are no troops 
preparing offensive operations against Iraq.  I rule that out 
categorically and I challenge anyone to provide proof to the 
contrary."  On political relations with the U.S., Muasher 
noted "we have differences, including of a substantial 
nature, with the United States with this war, but our 
relations with Washington are solid and strong, both on the 
political and on the economic level.  No one can question 
that."  On the outcome of the current situation, Muasher 
stated "There is no doubt about who is going to win this war, 
but a military victory is not necessarily a political 
victory.  The thought of imposing democracy in the Arab world 
is infantile.  Democracy is built up through participation; 
Iraq must belong to the Iraqis."
