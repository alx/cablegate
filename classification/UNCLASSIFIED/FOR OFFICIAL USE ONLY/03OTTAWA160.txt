Summary 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Canada's economy is like the "Energizer Bunny" - 
it just keeps going and going.  Canada should post a 
solid 3.3 percent annual increase in real GDP in 2002, 
which is more than double the 1.5 percent gain recorded 
in 2001.  All components of real GDP contributed to the 
increase with the exception of business investment in 
plant and equipment.  Positive business sentiment and an 
economy moving toward full capacity should reverse the 
trend in plant and equipment investment this year and 
next.  Other contributors to future growth include new 
spending by the government on health, the environment and 
defense - fueled by stronger tax revenues, and a recovery 
in the U.S. resulting in Canadian exports to more than 
double this year and continue to grow in 2004.  More 
balanced increases in investment, plus ongoing gains in 
consumer spending, round out the picture for why Canada's 
real economic growth should improve to 3.5 percent in 
2003 -- with the outlook for 2004 now estimated at 4.3 
percent.  End Summary. 
 
Introduction 
------------ 
 
¶2.   (SBU) Canada's economy grew at an annualized rate of 
3.1 percent in the third quarter of 2002, a sharp drop 
from the robust growth of 5.7 and 4.4 percent recorded in 
the first two quarters, respectively.  Exports 
contributed strongly to growth in IIIQ 2002, as did 
business investment in residential construction and in 
capital equipment.  However, growth was dampened by a 
slowdown in consumer spending (primarily in autos) and in 
the pace of inventory accumulation.  Following the 
anticipated 3.3 percent growth in 2002, we expect the 
Canadian economy to grow by 3.5 percent in 2003, and 4.3 
percent in 2004.  Domestic demand should stay strong over 
the forecast period, and solid growth estimates for the 
U.S. economy bode well for Canada's external sector.  We 
anticipate a tighter monetary policy beginning in late 
2003 and early 2004 as the Canadian economy reaches full 
capacity, which should slow quarterly growth rates in all 
sectors of the economy in the second half of 2004. 
Canada's inflation rate should remain in the upper end of 
the Bank of Canada's 1-3 percent target band, and the 
unemployment rate should stay at around 7.6 percent. 
 
 
Assumptions 
----------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) We assume the following: 
 
-- Real U.S. growth rates of 2.3 percent in 2002, 2.8 
percent in 2003, and 3.4 percert in 2004 (ref A). 
 
-- Real G-7 growth rates of 2.2 percent this year and 2.7 
percent next year (ref A). 
 
-- No major shocks in the oil and gas sector.  We assume 
that a `war premium' has already been built in. 
 
-- The GOC will introduce a stimulative budget in 
February 2003, implementing many of the recommendations 
of the November, 2002 Romanow Report on reforming 
Canada's health care system, providing incentives to meet 
the targets of the Kyoto Accord, and replacing outdated 
military equipment. 
-- The GOC will uphold its promises to the Canadian oil 
and gas sector made in exchange for their grudging 
support for Kyoto Accord ratification. 
 
-- Ontario, Canada's largest province demographically, 
will maintain its cap on residential electricity prices. 
(After the cap on electricity prices was lifted, 
residential electricity bills soared by 50 percent and 
more.  Ontario's Premier quickly reinstated the price cap 
late last year, and Ontarians have received C$75 per 
household rebate checks, which we assume were spent in 
December 2002 and are included in our IVQ 2002 forecast.) 
 
Risks 
----- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Risks to the forecast include: 
 
-- Sluggish growth in the U.S. economy (with special 
concern about flat employment growth); 
 
-- A longer-than-anticipated war with Iraq. 
 
 
 
Domestic Demand: Full Steam Ahead! 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) We forecast annualized quarterly growth rates 
between 2.8 and 4 percent in both private consumption and 
government spending over most of the forecast period. 
Domestic demand will be fuelled by the record 560,000 net 
new jobs in 2002.  Corporate profits and business 
investment intentions suggest aggregate employment should 
continue to grow this year and next (albeit not at the 
same rate as in 2002).  This translates into sizeable 
increases in consumer spending and a hefty boost for 
government tax revenues.  Business investment in non- 
residential construction and machinery/equipment is 
forecast to rise, while investment in residential 
construction should moderate after rising by over 15 
percent in 2002, the highest annual growth rate in 15 
years.  Pent-up demand and high vacancy rates accounted 
for the steep increase in residential construction in 
¶2002. 
 
New Spending On Health, Environment, Military Equipment 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) In FY2001-2002, Canada's net federal debt was 
C$536.5 billion, for a debt-to-GDP ratio of just over 49 
percent (down from almost 71 percent six years earlier). 
The debt reduction saves the GOC C$3 billion annually in 
interest payments, and provides increased fiscal 
flexibility.  In addition, strong employment growth 
points to larger-than-expected surpluses.  The Conference 
Board of Canada predicts possible GOC fiscal surpluses of 
almost C$20 billion in FY2002-2003 and FY2003-04, almost 
double the C$11 billion that Finance Minister Manley 
predicted in his fiscal update in October (ref B). 
However, we expect the GOC to respond to political 
pressure to spend part of the surplus on health care, the 
environment, and military equipment, with the remainder 
dedicated to further debt reduction, producing a balanced 
budget for FY2003-2004.  Manley has made it quite clear 
that the GOC will cut spending rather than risk a budget 
deficit. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Incremental spending increases introduced in 
FY2000 (on health care, defense spending, infrastructure, 
innovation, the environment, cities and aboriginal 
affairs) will continue this fiscal year and next. 
However, increased spending on health care and the 
environment seem likely in the upcoming federal budget. 
The GOC-commissioned Romanow Report recommends a C$15 
billion increase in health care spending over the next 
three fiscal years (in increments of C$3.5 billion, C$5 
billion, and C$6.5 billion).  Costs of ratification and 
implementation of the Kyoto Accord are unclear, but the 
GOC, to placate Canada's oil and gas sector,  has 
promised that the sector's contribution to meeting 
emission targets in the first commitment period of the 
Accord will be limited to C$15 per tonne. 
 
And Don't Rule Out The External Sector! 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (SBU) Canada's global merchandise trade surplus 
dropped by an estimated C$10 billion in 2002, to C$54 
billion (US$34.4 billion) from the previous year, as 
demand softened from Canada's major trading partners, in 
particular, the United States.  This resulted in a S$9.6B 
(US$6.1B) drop in Canada's global current account 
balance.  However, given U.S. and G-7 growth projections 
for the forecast period, Canadian exports should grow at 
a respectable rate, outpacing increases in investment- 
related imports.  In particular, energy exports should 
remain strong and so should exports of consumer durables 
and office machinery and equipment.  We forecast that 
Canada's global merchandise trade surplus will rise only 
slightly in 2003, to C$54.5B (US$34.7B), before climbing 
to C$66.9B (US$42.6B) in 2004.  The improvement is in 
line with the ongoing strength in the global and U.S. 
economies. 
 
Inflation 
--------- 
 
¶10. (SBU)  Canada's inflation rate, as measured by the 
year-over-year percent change in the All-Items Consumer 
Price Index, jumped to 4.3 percent in November 2002. 
However, Statistics Canada attributes the large increase 
to a sharp decline in the base used for comparison.  For 
example, the All-Items CPI fell by an unusually steep 
monthly 0.9 percent between October and November 2001, 
so without a similar drop in the index in 2002, the year- 
over-year percent change is exaggerated.  (Note: The 
monthly decline in November 2001 was attributed to a 
steep drop in energy prices and traveler accommodation. 
The same factors caused the All-Items CPI to drop by 0.5 
percent in October 2001 from the previous month.)  We 
expect Canada's inflation rate to remain at the upper 
end of the Bank of Canada's 1-3 percent target band. 
However, there is a risk of higher inflation in the 
second half of 2003 as the Canadian economy reaches full 
capacity. 
 
Monetary Policy 
--------------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) The Bank of Canada (BOC) is still looking for 
an opportunity to take back some of the low-interest 
stimulus that it pumped into the Canadian economy last 
year.  While the BOC continues a "made in Canada" 
monetary policy, i.e., not following the Fed in lockstep, 
we believe that monetary policy will tighten later this 
year once the Canadian economy reaches full capacity.  We 
expect the spread between U.S. and Canadian short-term 
interest rates to remain at roughly 175 basis points in 
favor of Canada.  While we do not forecast exchange 
rates, we believe the Canadian dollar will continue 
trading in the upper-63 cents range vis--vis the U.S. 
dollar.  Any appreciation linked to tighter monetary 
policy will be erased as the Fed increases U.S. interest 
rates.  While the weaker dollar is a boon for Canadian 
exporters, it makes investment-related imports and 
consumer durables much more expensive.
