MFA International Organizations Cam Oguz advised (5/4) that 
Turkey is unlikely to develop a position on the "no 
reservation" clause of the Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control prior to the World Health Assembly meeting.  However, 
U/S FT DDG Agreements Husnu Dilemre said that under the 
customs union with the EU, the GOT is obligated to toe the EU 
line and support the inclusion of the clause.  In the 
unlikely event that the EU position changes, Turkey would 
probably join the EU consensus, he said. The lead agency on 
the convention, the Ministry of Health, received demarche 
materials on 5/2, but has not developed a position.
