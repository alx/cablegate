REF: STATE 109397 
 
¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points on October 26 to Emil 
Hreggvidsson, Deputy Director for International and Security Affairs 
at the Icelandic Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  Hreggvidsson said 
that Iceland's objectives for the upcoming session of the UN General 
Assembly Third Committee closely align with those of the United 
States. 
¶2. (SBU) Hreggvidsson said that Iceland, like the United States, is 
troubled by "no-action motions" and will oppose their use.  It is 
also Iceland's intention, he continued, to co-sponsor the three 
country-specific resolutions against Iran, Burma and the DPRK. 
Regarding the thematic resolutions, Hreggvidsson said that Iceland 
will likely join the U.S. in opposing the defamation of religions 
resolution and will support the U.S. sponsored elections resolution. 
 He was also pleased to hear that the U.S. is looking to find common 
ground on the rights of the child resolution.  The Government of 
Iceland, he said, considers protecting children's rights a top 
priority and intends to make a speech supporting the issue at the 
Third Committee.
