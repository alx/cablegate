¶1. Post was contacted 11/21 by Turkish MFA Coordinator for 
Iraq Assistance Ahmet Okcun regarding reftel demarche.  Okcun

training of Iraqi police, but would like to do it at the 
Turkish police training facility in Diyarbakir.  Turkey, 
Okcun said, would not participate in the police training in 
Jordan, but was looking favorably at the possibility of 
sending some police trainers to Iraq as well.

in December and will be available for further discussion of 
this issue.
