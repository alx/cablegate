SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR PRESENTS CREDENTIALS 
 
¶1. (U)The Ambassador presented his credentials on January 11 to 
the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, becoming 
the first U.S. ambassador to Tripoli since 1972.  In a brief, 
simple ceremony at the offices of the General People's Congress, 
Secretary of the General People's Congress Muftah Kaybah 
received the Ambassador's credentials.  He was accompanied by: 
Secretary of the General People's Congress for Foreign Liaison 
and International Cooperation Suleiman Shahumi (SFRC 
Chair-equivalent); MFA Secretary for Arab Affairs Muhammad Taher 
Siala (A/S-equivalent), MFA Protocol Head of Privileges and 
Immunities al-Mahdi al-Ouwdi; and MFA Director of the Americas 
Department Muhammad Matari (DAS-equivalent). 
 
¶2. (U) In brief remarks, the Ambassador underscored how far 
relations had evolved in the past five years, stressing that 
implementation of the U.S.-Libya claims compensation agreement 
and the recent exchange of ambassadors (Libyan Ambassador Ali 
Aujali presented his credentials at the White House on January 
8) marked a turning of the page on the contretemps of the past. 
The U.S. was keen to deepen the range of bilateral engagement, 
to include building a new embassy compound, providing full visa 
services to Libyan applicants, expanding commercial ties, 
increasing the number of Libyan students studying in the U.S., 
re-establishing people-to-people ties that had lapsed since the 
1970's, and exploring more robust military-to-military 
engagement.  The U.S. would also engage the Libyan government on 
key issues of principle, such as human rights, as it does with 
all nations with whom it enjoys diplomatic relations. 
 
¶3. (U) Secretary Kaybah offered remarks welcoming the 
Ambassador's arrival and attendant elevation of bilateral 
diplomatic representation, and stressing Libya's desire to work 
cooperatively with the U.S.  The strategic and historic decision 
of Leader Muammar al-Qadhafi to renounce terrorism and abandon 
WMD programs had facilitated the historic process of U.S.-Libya 
re-engagement, he said.  He emphasized that Libya's record of 
participation in various international bodies focused on human 
rights was long and distinguished, and cautioned the U.S. and 
others to remain mindful of the fact that human rights should be 
interpreted in each country's "unique historical and cultural 
context".
