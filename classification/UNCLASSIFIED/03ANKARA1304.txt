--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
 
¶1. MINISTER PROPOSES THEN WITHDRAWS DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. 
New Environment Minister Imdat Sutulogul forwarded proposed 
environmental legislation to Parliament, and then withdrew 
it about a month later.  The proposed law was designed to 
strengthen the traditionally weak Ministry by assigning it 
new authorities and financing, and resolving conflicting 
responsibilities with other agencies.  It appeared to have 
included a 10 percent fee for plastic bottles that would 
have troubled soft-drink bottlers, such as Coca-Cola and and 
Pepsi-Cola.  The legislation would have been the first major 
revision in environmental law since 1997. Post will follow 
developments and report. 
 
 
¶2. WSSD FOLLOW-UP.  A consultant to the Ministry of 
Environment (MOE) is pouring through WSSD documents to 
compare the commitments that Turkey made at WSSD with 
Turkey's laws, EU directives, State Planning Office (SPO) 
policies, MOE programs and other national regulations. 
Turkey will continue to seek WSSD partnerships between now 
and the completion of the lengthy tome. 
 
 
¶3. EURO 126 MILLION FOR ACCESSION PREPARATION. The European 
Commission has approved Euro 126-million for a pre-accession 
financial assistance program to assist Turkey in preparing 
for EU membership. One of the five key areas to be studied 
will address strengthening public administration to improve 
phytosanitary and veterinary controls, maritime safety, and 
environmental inspection. 
 
 
¶4. LAW ON MEMBERSHIP GOES INTO EFFECT. The law addressing 
Turkey's joining the European Environment Agency and 
participating in the European Environment Information and 
Observation Network entered into force on January 28. As a 
part of its membership obligation, Turkey will pay dues of 
Euro 2,033,000 (USD 2.2 million) the first year, of which 
MEDA (European-Mediterranean Partnership) will pay Euro 
1,524,750 (USD 1.65 million).  The fee increases and MEDA 
contribution decreases the second year.  By the third year, 
Turkey will bear the full membership fee -- Euro 3,127,000 
(USD 3.3 million). 
 
 
¶5. REC TURKEY MOVES FORWARD.  Representatives from REC 
Budapest confirm that plans for REC Turkey are proceeding on 
schedule.  REC Budapest's Deputy Executive Director 
reiterated that ratification of the REC Turkey Charter by 
the Turkish Parliament is expected within two months.  REC 
Budapest anticipates that the required bilateral agreement 
will be signed and ratified by June so the REC could begin 
operation that month with allotted EU funding.  There is 
still no agreement on legal status (association, foundation, 
special designation) for the REC.  A donors meeting would be 
held after opening the office. 
 
 
¶6. MUNICIPAL RECYCLING POSTPONED. The Ministry of 
Environment (MOE) is still seeking to engage the Ankara 
Metropolitan Municipality in its proposed national recycling 
program. Although the draft agreement between MOE and the 
municipality was completed in August, the municipality has 
yet to sign.  On a related note, Ankara recently began a USD 
270 million solid waste project in cooperation with a Swiss 
company. 
 
 
¶7. POSSIBLE SOURCE OF HEPATITIS B AND C IN ANKARA. A press 
release from the Ankara Governate advised that local 
governing bodies have prohibited the use of waters from the 
Ankara Stream for irrigation purposes due to recent 
outbreaks of Hepatitis B and C among some who use those 
waters.
