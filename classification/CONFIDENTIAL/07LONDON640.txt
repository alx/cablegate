Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Maura Connelly for reasons 
1.4 (b, d) 
 
(C) The UK will try to persuade Iceland not to withdraw its 
Mobile Liaison Observation Team from PRT Chaghcharan 
(reftel).  Richard Rose of the Foreign and Commonwealth 
Office's Afghanistan Group told Poloff February 16 that the 
UK has been working with Iceland to increase military 
cooperation in Afghanistan, and provided Iceland a seat at 
last year's London Conference on Afghanistan on the basis of 
London's understanding that Iceland is committed to  actively 
helping Afghanistan.  Rose added that Denmark is also in a 
position to be very helpful in pressing Iceland on this 
matter.
