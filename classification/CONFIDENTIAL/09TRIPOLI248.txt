¶1. (SBU) This is an action request. Please see para 4.

¶2. (C) On March 20, the Libyan General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation (MFA-equivalent) delivered a diplomatic note proposing the United States and Libya sign a bilateral aviation agreement and that state-owned Afriqiyah Airlines start regular flights to the United States in the summer of 2009. Attached to the note was an Arabic translation of a 14-page aviation agreement. The text of the diplomatic note said the Libyan Civil Aviation Authority had expressed its initial approval of the provisions included in the agreement. This agreement appears to be an Arabic translation of the 2001 Multilateral Agreement on the Liberalization of International Air Transportation (MALIAT) with New Zealand, Singapore, Brunei, and Chile. The note also said that the GOL would like to sign a bilateral aviation agreement with the United States during the visit of a high-level Libyan official in late April or early May. Post has sent via unclassified e-mail the diplomatic note and attachment to NEA/MAG.

¶3. (C) Post had no prior knowledge that Libya wanted to negotiate an aviation agreement or commence direct flights by one of its state-owned airlines to the United States. (Note: Wholly-owned by the Libyan government, Afriqiyah Airlines was established in 2001 with the goal of providing air service to the African continent. Its livery features the logo, "9.9.99", a reference to the date of the "Sirte Proclamation," an agreement by African states reached in Muammar al-Qadhafi's home-town that led to the creation of the African Union. The other state-owned airline is Libyan Arab Airlines. End note)

¶4. (C) Post seeks Department's advice in responding to the GOL's request. It would be helpful to be able to address the following questions: -If Libya wants to sign onto the 2001 Multilateral Agreement on the Liberalization of International Air Transportation (MALIAT), is it eligible to do so? -If Libya seeks a bilateral agreement with the United States, what are the next steps? -If Libya wants to commence direct flights between Tripoli and a U.S. airport, what requirements would need to be met?
