CLIMATE CHANGE IN TIBET, SAYS POLITICAL AGENDA CAN WAIT
REF: A. 08 NEW DELHI 2884  B. NEW DELHI 1487
Classified By: Ambassador Timothy J. Roemer for Reasons 1.4 (B and D)
¶1. (C) SUMMARY. In a August 8 introductory meeting, the Ambassador sought the Dalai Lama’s views on his upcoming October visit to the U.S. and his strategy for engaging China. The Dalai Lama suggested the U.S. engage China on climate change in Tibet, recognizing that Tibetans could wait five to ten years for a political solution. The Ambassador assured the Dalai Lama that climate change was a priority for President Obama and the U.S. was prepared to work with China and India. Regarding next steps in dialogue with China, the Dalai Lama reported that he awaited a positive sign from China before attempting to reengage the PRC; in the meantime, he continued to strengthen ties with Chinese scholars and authors. The Dalai Lama supported closer U.S.-India relations and praised the Secretary’s recent visit to India. He doubted the sustainability of China’s authoritarian regime and warned that if China achieved its global aspirations, it would resemble the former Soviet Union. The Dalai Lama said he had no specific goals for his trip to Washington, adding that President Obama should not expect any change in the Tibetans’ stance. END SUMMARY.
Focus on Climate Change
---------- 
¶2. (C) The Dalai Lama argued that the political agenda should be sidelined for five to ten years and the international community should shift its focus to climate change on the Tibetan plateau. Melting glaciers, deforestation, and increasingly polluted water from mining projects were problems that “cannot wait.” The Dalai Lama criticized China’s energy policy, alleging that dam construction in Kham and Amdo have displaced thousands of Tibetans and left temples and monasteries underwater. He recommended the PRC compensate Tibetans for disrupting their nomadic lifestyle with vocational training, such as weaving.
¶3. (C) The Dalai Lama requested the United States consider engaging China on environmental issues in Tibet and suggested increased collaboration between U.S. and Chinese scientists. The Ambassador assured the Dalai Lama that President Obama remained concerned about climate change and specifically asked him to address the issue in India and the region.
Waiting for the PRC to Reengage
---------- 
¶4. (C) The Dalai Lama reiterated that while his faith in the Chinese government had grown “thinner” after eight rounds of failed negotiations, his faith in the Chinese people had “never shaken.” During the past year, the Dalai Lama met with several hundred Chinese scholars and writers to discuss Tibet. The Dalai Lama was heartened by the increased “expressions of solidarity from Chinese brothers and sisters” and reported that 682 Chinese-language articles focused on Tibet were published over the past year. The Dalai Lama conveyed he would continue to engage the Chinese people who wanted a more open society.
¶5. (C) The Dalai Lama provided the Ambassador with a brief account of the most recent negotiations between his envoys and the PRC, expressing disappointment that the Chinese government had rejected the Memorandum for Genuine Autonomy before his envoys reached Beijing (Ref A). When Ambassador Roemer inquired about sending envoys to Beijing again, The Dalai Lama needed some positive sign from the PRC that it was prepared for substantive dialogue because Tibetans currently felt China preferred “ruthless oppression.” On the sidelines of the meeting, Representative of the Dalai Lama in India Tempa Tsering told Poloff that the clarification note for the Memorandum of Autonomy had not been completed and confirmed he would send the Embassy a copy of the note after its completion (Ref B).
PRC’s Authoritarian System “Not Sustainable”
---------- 
¶6. (C) The Dalai Lama told the Ambassador that “narrow mindedness” had led China to feel threatened by Tibetans’ desire to preserve their culture and language. “The past was

the past,” and now Tibetans and Chinese must envision a new reality based on “common sense and common interest.” The European Union and United Kingdom were examples of countries uniting for these reasons, while preserving national identity. He cited these examples as high goals to aspire toward for this region’s peace and prosperity. The Dalai Lama acknowledged the greatness of China and its people, but maintained that the authoritarian system was not sustainable.  If China succeeded in becoming a superpower, it would resemble the former Soviet Union, securing its rule using suspicion and fear. The U.S. should consider China’s values when doing business with the PRC and strive to bring China into the democratic mainstream.
October Visit
---------- 
¶7. (SBU) When the Ambassador asked about the objective of his October visit to Washington, the Dalai Lama replied that he had “no particular points at this moment,” adding President Obama should not anticipate a shift from the Middle Way. He underlined that Prime Minister-in-exile Samdhong Rinpoche was the “real authority” and would set the political agenda. The Dalai Lama applauded efforts to strengthen the U.S.-India relationship, adding it was “logical and essential” for the two greatest democracies to collaborate closely. He told the Ambassador that his Indian friends praised the Secretary’s visit and urged the U.S. and India to continue along this positive trajectory, “whether other countries like it or not.” The Ambassador said the U.S.-India partnership is a top priority for President Obama and Secretary Clinton and we were pursuing a broad and deep strategic partnership.
¶8. (C) COMMENT. The Dalai Lama’s message to the Ambassador may signal a broader shift in strategy to reframe the Tibet issue as an environmental concern. When Ambassador Roemer discussed the importance of climate change issues and mentioned bilateral projects between the U.S. and India, the Dalai Lama said that there were “three poles” in danger of melting: the north pole, the south pole, and the glaciers at the pole of Tibet. Tibetans have watched closely as the United States launched the new Strategic and Economic Dialogue with China, with climate change as a main focus, as well as the Secretary’s emphasis on climate change during her July visit to India. In this new context, the Dalai Lama appears intent on leveraging closer U.S.-China relations to address the pressing environmental challenges and problems in Tibet. END COMMENT. ROEMER
