1.(C) Poleconoff delivered reftel demarche to Ieva Jirgensone, acting head of the MFA's Arms Proliferation Division. Jirgensone thanked us for the report and mentioned that this was the only route that they received this information. She stated that Latvia very much wants to become a member of the MTCR. She has heard that Russia is lobbying for Kazakhstan's acceptance into the Australia Group, and that there has been talk about a trade - EU support for Kazakhstan in return for Russian support for remaining EU countries joining the MTCR.

2.(C) Jirgensone stated that Latvia's export control is excellent, and that the heaviest burden falls to customs, which carefully reviews every case. She stated that Latvia's missile technology expertise is not high, but all necessary legislation is in place, and noted that this knowledge gap is why information exchange is important. ROGERS
