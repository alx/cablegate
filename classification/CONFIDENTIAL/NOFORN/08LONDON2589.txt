SUBJECT: SOMALIA: UK SUPPORTS USG COMPROMISE LANGUAGE IN SANCTIONS UNSC RESOLUTION REF: STATE 108662 

Classified By: Political Counselor Richard Mills, reasons 1.4 (b/d). (C/NF) On the draft Somalia sanctions UNSC resolution (reftel), the UK is willing to drop "as designated by the Committee" from OP 3 and supports the compromise language in OP 14 stating the Council's intention to "review" the measures in twelve months, according to FCO Sanctions Officer Felicity Jones. Jones told us October 10 that London did not support UKUN's suggestion to include "as designated by the Committee or by Member States," and it would be best to drop the clause entirely. Additionally, the compromise language on time limitations "suits HMG fine." Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
