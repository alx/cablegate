¶1.       (SBU)  SUMMARY:   Former Guantanamo Bay (GTMO) detainee
Moazzam Begg met with Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn 14 January
2010 to press the government of Luxembourg to accept GTMO detainees
for resettlement.  Begg, a British citizen of Pakistani origin, was
arrested in Pakistan in 2002 and imprisoned in Kandahar, Bagram,
and Guantanamo Bay, before his release to Britain in 2005. In a
statement to RTL Television, Asselborn said that Luxembourg will do
what is possible and reiterated the government's position to
provide financial assistance, training and housing costs, and other
technical assistance.  Consular officer attended an evening
screening of the documentary film "Taxi to the Dark Side," followed
by a Q&A session with Begg.  When asked if he thought Luxembourg
will do more than contribute financially to the resettlement
efforts, Begg replied that he was "pleasantly surprised" with his
conversations with MFA officials and "hopeful." END SUMMARY

--------------------------------------------

AUDIENCE WITH FOREIGN MINISTER

--------------------------------------------

¶2.       (C)  Ex-GTMO detainee Moazzam Begg, released from
Guantanamo Bay in 2005, is barnstorming throughout Europe, pushing
governments to accept GTMO detainees for resettlement.  Following
his release from GTMO, Begg created an NGO dedicated to this cause,
called Caged Prisoners.  Representatives from two additional NGOs,
Reprieve and Center for Constitutional Rights, accompanied Begg on
his visit to Luxembourg.  Luxembourg media coverage on the
Asselborn-Begg meeting was ubiquitous, but superficial.  With
numerous reports that the meeting occurred, nearly all media
outlets were silent on the actual substance of the meeting.  Only
Begg provided some limited insight into the outcome of the meeting.
Speaking later in the evening (see para 4), he responded to an
inquiry about the meeting by saying that "without giving anything
away," he was "pleasantly surprised" and "hopeful."

--------------------------------------------- -----------

ASSELBORN: "WE'LL HELP"/BEGG:  "DO MORE"

--------------------------------------------- -----------

¶3.       (C)  In an interview following his meeting with Begg,
Asselborn avoided specifics of the discussion.  He reiterated
Luxembourg's willingness to provide financial assistance to the
resettlement efforts - the GoL party line for many months.
Asselborn said, however, that he was in regular contact with
American officials, including Special Envoy Dan Fried, as recently
as last week.  (See refs a and b on the Asselborn-Fried meeting in
September 2009 in Luxembourg and subsequent exchange of letters.)
In comments to the press following the meeting, Begg only explained
what the messages he delivered were - not how those messages were
received. Begg's primary message is that European governments have
to step up and accept some of the GTMO detainees for resettlement.
Begg, an articulate man, argued that there are dozens of prisoners
in GTMO just like him - not dangerous to society, able to
communicate and assimilate, able to be a contributing and
responsible member of society - and they just need governments to
stand up and offer them a place to call home. In an interview prior
to his meeting with Asselborn, Begg was asked if countries like
Luxembourg have a responsibility regarding ex-detainees. Begg
reportedly responded that it is a European tradition to offer
asylum to refugees, and that this tradition also should be extended
to former Guantanamo detainees who have not been convicted of
crimes, are not dangerous, and are deemed as releasable.

TAXI TO HELL

----------------

¶4.      (SBU)  Begg later attended an Amnesty International-hosted
screening of 2007 Oscar Winner for Best Documentary "Taxi to the
Dark Side" (French translation of film title: "Taxi to Hell").
Conoff attended screening and Begg's Q&A session following the
film. The film, a harrowing depiction of alleged torture inside
Bagram, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanamo, was an undisguised attack on
the Bush Administration, focusing much of its venom on Former
Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Former Vice President Cheney. Mr.
Begg, on the other hand, presented an image of "forgive, but never
forget," and has focused his attentions not on the ill treatment he
allegedly received, but on what can be done to resettle the
remaining "releasable" prisoners in Guantanamo Bay.  Reporting
officer estimates 100-150 people attended the filming and Q&A
session and noted the complete absence of press, other diplomats,
or GoL officials.

--------------------------------------------- -

LOOKING FORWARD, NOT BACKWARD

--------------------------------------------- -

¶5.       (C)  During his presentation, Begg spoke almost
exclusively of the future, with hardly any mention of the past.  He
did not discuss the question of legality of torture.  Rather than
stressing past injustices, he focused on what to do now.  He
acknowledged that he lives with the past, but that he now wants to
be part of the solution, and is working to convince Luxembourg and
other governments - and their populaces - to want the same.

---------------------------------------

LUXEMBOURGERS NOT SO SURE

---------------------------------------

¶6.       (SBU)  In a 90-minute Q&A session, Begg was asked, how
would ex-detainees fit in in Luxembourg.  How would it work? Where
would they live? How would they be supported?  The fear and
skepticism was palpable in the audience.  Begg and his NGO cohorts
stressed that there were Algerians and Tunisians in GTMO who could
come to Luxembourg and speak French, one of Luxembourg's official
and most-commonly used languages.  He stressed that neighboring
countries - France, Belgium, Portugal, Ireland - provided examples.
Begg even argued that if detainees could fit in in Palau, they
could do the same in Luxembourg.  Begg deplored that certain people
believe the world is not big enough for the ex-detainees.  He added
that if there were colonies on the Moon, "I'm sure they'd send us
there."

¶7.       (SBU)  Begg declined to speak about specific physical
transgressions against his person.  When told how physically well
and mentally sound he appeared, he joked, "Well, I used to be
taller."  Begg spoke articulately, demonstrating minimal ill will
toward his captors - even going so far as to say he speaks on the

LUXEMBOURG 00000005  003 OF 003

phone occasionally with his former interrogators.  Consular officer
took note of the following exchange:  Asked if he would ever
consider a return to the U.S., Begg replied that he had never been
to the U.S., but that the U.S. had come to him.  Begg commented
that as a British citizen, he could travel to the U.S. without a
visa, but that he thinks he would need "a lot more than a visa to
get out."

COMMENT

-------------

¶8.      (C)  Mr. Begg is doing our work for us, and his articulate,
reasoned presentation makes for a convincing argument.  It is
ironic that after four years of imprisonment and alleged torture,
Moazzam Begg is delivering the same demarche to GOL as we are:
please consider accepting GTMO detainees for resettlement.  Despite
Begg's optimism, the Prime and Foreign Ministers continue to
publicly state that the GoL supports the closure of the Guantanamo
Bay detention facility and stands ready to assist from a financial
and logistical perspective, but cannot accept detainees for
resettlement.

¶9.       (U)  Please see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moazzam_Begg
and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_to_the_Dark _Side for
extensive information on Moazzam Begg and the film "Taxi to the
Dark Side."
