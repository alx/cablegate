Classified By: Amb. Carol van Voorst for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1.  (SBU) A/DCM and ConOff delivered Ref A demarche and model 
document to Ministry for Foreign Affairs Desk Officer for the U.S. 
(and Deputy Chief of the Defense Department) Audunn Atlason and 
MFA Defense Department First Secretary Ingibjorg Petursdottir on 
November 21.  Emboffs also referred to Department briefing for 
Icelandic Minister of Justice Bjarnason in Washington on October 
29 (Ref B). 
 
¶2.  (C) Atlason noted the MFA's receipt of the demarche and said 
the Ministry would coordinate the Icelandic government response. 
He echoed MOJ Bjarnason's sentiment that the 2006 U.S.-Iceland 
Joint Understanding would be a useful framework for an agreement 
to exchange terrorist screening information.  Atlason said he was 
not sure whether a December visit by a USG interagency team would 
be feasible, but that the MFA would work to provide post with an 
answer as soon as possible.  He added that the MFA would be 
appreciative of further information on which Visa Waiver Program 
countries have already concluded such agreements.
