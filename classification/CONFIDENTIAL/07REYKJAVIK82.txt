SUBJECT: ICELAND NON-COMMITTAL ON RESETTLEMENT OF GUANTANAMO DETAINEES 
 
REF: STATE 37005; STATE 36991 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Carol van Voorst for reasons 1.4 (b) and 
(d). 
 
¶1. (C) On March 26 Ambassador discussed resettlement of Guantanamo 
detainees in a meeting with Foreign Minister Valgerdur Sverrisdottir 
and MFA advisor Jorundur Valtysson. Sverrisdottir said she would 
welcome the eventual closing of the detention facility but her 
government would need to study closely the request for detainee 
resettlement.  She will get back to us with a formal reply. 
 
¶2. (C) Note:  Iceland admits around 25 refugees a year through the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHRC).  The 
government has previously been unwilling to accept a larger number or 
to admit them outside the UNHCR mechanism.
