Classified By: Political Counselor Rick Mills for reasons 1.4 (b) and ( d)  

¶1.  (C) Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Iran Coordination Group Multilateral Team Leader Will Gelling, in several conversations January 8 with London Iran Watcher (Poloff) on ref b, said  HMG would stand with USG if there is a vote but deferred to FCO officials leading on the issue. Gelling said UK Political Director Mark Grant's office had cancelled its recommended call to P on the issue due to the Undersecretary's absence from Washington.  

¶2.  (C) Poloff also contacted FCO's International Organizations office (William Gatward) and passed on Department's suggestion (ref a), that HMG request  UNDP member governments and UNDP officials to delay the January 9 vote.  

¶3.  (C) Gatward, however, called Poloff back to advise that HMG firmly opposes the USG suggestion to call a vote on the issue, rather than allowing the Board's standard silence procedures to operate.  Gatward said HMG estimates any vote on the issue would be lost regardless of when a vote occurred, due to opposition by G-77 governments who sit on the UNDP board.  HMG also believes the position at stake is a relatively unimportant one, and that in the atmosphere created by violence in Gaza any lobbying of UNDP Board member governments by HMG or USG would be especially counterproductive and would needlessly draw attention to what HMG sees as an inevitable win for Iran.  Gatward said the mutual USG-UK objective should be to draw as little attention to the matter as possible, and allow standard Board no-objection procedures to operate, "with Iran going through on the nod."  

¶4.  (C) Gatward said he would follow up directly with IO officials by phone today January 8 and that UK Embassy Washington would also be briefing Department today on HMG views.   Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
