¶1.  (S/NF)  A NUMBER OF POLICYMAKERS ARE INTERESTED IN 
KNOWING THE STATUS OF THE CURRENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CUBA AND RUSSIA, GIVEN THE ANIMOSITY BOTH GOVERNMENTS SHARE TOWARD THE UNITED STATES AND IN LIGHT OF THE NUMEROUS PRESS REPORTS  SUGGESTING A CLOSER BILATERAL PARTNERSHIP.  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS HAVE WRITTEN SEVERAL PIECES ON THIS TOPIC IN THE  PAST; HOWEVER, ANALYSTS ARE LOOKING TO WRITE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT ANALYZING THE BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP.  ANALYSTS WOULD READ WITH INTEREST ANY 
INFORMATION POST COULD PROVIDE ON THE TOPICS BELOW, AS TIME AND RESOURCES PERMIT.  MANY THANKS, AND REGARDS FROM WASHINGTON.

¶D.  (S/NF)  FOR MOSCOW: WHICH BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP DOES RUSSIA VIEW AS A HIGHER PRIORITY?  CUBA OR VENEZUELA?  WHY? 
 
¶E.  (S/NF)  FOR HAVANA AND MOSCOW: HAVE CUBAN DIPLOMATS OR OTHER CUBAN OFFICIALS EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION IN WORKING WITH THEIR RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS?  IF SO, WHY?  CONVERSELY, HAVE RUSSIANS EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION? 
 
¶F.  (S/NF)  FOR HAVANA AND MOSCOW: HOW FAR ARE THE CUBANS WILLING TO GO TO ACCOMMODATE OR SUPPORT RUSSIAN MILITARY OPERATIONS, INCLUDING LONG RANGE AVIATION ACTIVITIES?  WHAT, IF ANYTHING, ARE THE RUSSIANS ASKING THE CUBANS FOR IN TERMS OF SUPPORT? WHAT WOULD THE CUBANS RECEIVE IN RETURN?
