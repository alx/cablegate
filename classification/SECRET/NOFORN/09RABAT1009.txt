RABAT 00001009 001.2 OF 002 


Classified By: Charge d'Affaires, a.i., Robert P. Jackson for reasons 1 
.4 (b) and (d). 

¶1. (S) Summary: Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chief 
of Staff and Director General of Multilateral Relations 
Nasser Bourita told the Charge on December 28 that the health 
of wounded Guinean junta leader Captain Moussa Dadis Camara 
has improved and that he has sought to leave Morocco. 
Bourita reiterated that Dadis Camara arrived without prior 
consultation with the GOM, but he was allowed into Morocco 
for treatment of his wounds. Charge noted that Guinea seems 
to have become calmer in Camara's absence and stressed that 
it would be helpful if he were to remain out of the country. 
Bourita stated that the GOM shared U.S. concerns about the 
stability of Guinea and the region and wished to help find a 
solution, but he added that there are no grounds upon which 
to keep Camara any longer. He urged the U.S. and France to 
avoid making any public request that Morocco keep Dadis 
Camara. End Summary. 

¶2. (S/NF) In a meeting on December 28, Moroccan MFA Chief of 
Staff Nasser Bourita told Charge and A/PolCouns that Dadis 
Camara had wanted to leave Morocco last week but that the GOM 
decided to keep him here until the end of the month for 
continuing medical treatment. He added that Guinean Minister 
of National Defense Sekouba Konate is due to arrive about 
20:30 GMT on December 28 to visit Dadis, who is still the 
leader of Guinea. Bourita suggested that Konate was not 
preparing to take over that role. Konate has wanted to see 
Dadis for some time, presumably to make his own assessment of 
Dadis, health. XXXXXXXXXXXX 
corroborates that a plane carrying Konate has left Conakry. 

¶3. (C) In explaining the GOM's desire to help find a 
peaceful solution to the problems in Guinea, Bourita said 
Morocco's relations with Guinea and other countries must be 
taken into consideration. It is not for Morocco, he said, to 
turn Dadis Camara over to the ICC. He added that were a 
Security Council resolution forthcoming, it would put the GOM 
in a difficult position but would, of course, be binding. 
Bourita asked rhetorically whether "out of Guinea" meant "in 
Morocco" or that Morocco should help find a third-country 
location for Dadis Camara. Bourita stressed that the U.S. 
and France should avoid any public request for Morocco to 
keep Dadis. Bourita further urged that the U.S. and France 
should maintain contact with Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi 
Fihri while the Minister is in Tripoli, Libya, for the Arab 
Maghreb Union Ministerial, December 28 to 30. 

¶4. (C) Echoing comments made to A/PolCouns several weeks ago 
by the MFA Director of African Affairs, Bourita went on to 
say that it would be better to find a way to deal with Dadis 
Camara in Guinea. He noted that Dadis still enjoyed 
considerable support in the country and stressed the need to 
keep Dadis calm and confident about his future. To do 
otherwise, he said, risked more violence and more bloodshed. 

¶5. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX  declared that Dadis' 
return to Guinea would lead to significant problems. He said 
he learned from doctors attending to Dadis that he was doing 
quite well, and he confirmed that Konate was on his way to 
Rabat to meet with the junta leader and perhaps return with 
him to Guinea. XXXXXXXXXXXX
 said he had contacted General Mamadouba 
Toto Camara in Conakry and was told Dadis' imminent return to 
Guinea "was a lie." 


RABAT 00001009 002.2 OF 002 


¶6. (C) Comment: While we understand both from Bourita and 
from French Ambassador Joubert that French President Sarkozy 
planned to discuss Guinea with King Mohammed VI during their 
&family dinner8 on December 27, there do not appear to have 
been any breakthroughs. 

¶7. (S/NF) We believe Bourita is sincere in expressing the 
GOM's desire to help Guinea. However, with no legal or 
medical basis to keep Dadis here and without any country 
other than Libya prepared to accept him on a legal or medical 
basis, Bourita's suggestion that Dadis be dealt with in 
Guinea may be the only viable option. End Comment. 

¶8. (U) Tripoli minimize considered.
