Classified By: Charge Philip S. Kosnett for reasons 1.4 (b), (d). 
 
¶1. (S/NF) Summary:  Iceland is attending the NAM Summit in 
Havana primarily to campaign for a 2009-2010 UN Security 
Council seat, and claims no interest in NAM membership or 
increased engagement with the Government of Cuba. The GOI did 
not receive a landing clearance request in connection with 
Belarusian President Lukashenko's planned travel to the 
summit, and if asked would deny such a request per 
EU/Schengen policy.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Poloff met with Thordur Bjarni Gudjonson, Acting 
Political Director at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on 
September 6 and again on September 11 to deliver ref A and B 
points.  Per Gudjonson, Iceland is attending the Sept. 11-16 
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Havana as an observer, 
with the primary goal of working the margins of the summit to 
lobby for a seat on the UN Security Council in 2009-2010. 
Gudjonson said Iceland will be represented at the NAM summit 
by Amb. Sigridur Asdis Snaevarr, who is directing Iceland's 
UNSC campaign. 
 
¶3. (C) Gudjonson added that the GOI's participation does not 
constitute an official visit to the Government of Cuba nor 
reflect any interest in joining NAM.  That said, Gudjonson 
agreed with much of the content of reftel demarches and said 
the GOI would look for chances to influence any final NAM 
declarations "in a positive direction." 
 
¶4.  (S/NF) Poloff also asked whether Iceland had received a 
landing clearance request from Belarusian President 
Lukashenko, who had reportedly intended to refuel in Iceland 
on his way to the NAM summit (ref C).  Gudjonson said Iceland 
had not, and gave assurances that any such requests would be 
denied, as Iceland (a Schengen state) has joined the EU in 
restricting Belarusian officials' travel.  "He's on the list."
