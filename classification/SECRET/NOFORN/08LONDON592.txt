LONDON 00000592 001.2 OF 003 Classified By: SANDRA CLARK, A/ECON MINISTER FOR REASONS 1.4 B & D ACTION REQUEST. PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 6

1.(S/NF) SUMMARY: The UK plans to designate three Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) individuals to the UN 1267 committee in the next few weeks, but first requests any USG information on the potential designees and whether we will support the designation. Once they get U.S. agreement to the designation, the UK will pre-notify Libya, China and Russia, and eventually the other G-7 members and the EU members of the Security Council. The UK is not currently asking the U.S. to co-sponsor. END SUMMARY

2.(S/NF) The UK plans to designate three Libyan members of LIFG (Maftah Mohamed ELMABRUK; Abdelrazag Elsharif ELOSTA; and Abdulbasit ABDULRAHIM) to the UN's 1267 committee soon, according to Giles Cutler, 1267 Expert on the Sanctions Team, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). Cutler supplied us with a current draft of the Statement of Case (SOC) (Para 5), which, if approved at the minister-level, will be the version given to the UN, other members and the designees themselves.

Timeline --------

3.(S/NF) Once the USG shares our information on these individuals with the UK, and assures that we support the designations, the SOC will go to FCO ministers for approval - which should take three to five days, according to Cutler. It is unclear if Foreign Secretary Milliband needs to approve this directly. Within a few days of ministerial approval, the UK will pre-notify Libya, China and Russia, which will begin the two-week clock prior to submitting names to the UN. Later in that two-week window, the UK will pre-notify the other G-7 countries and EU members of the UN Security Council.

4.(S/NF) The UK has not yet approached any other governments regarding these names, nor have they shared the SOC with UK embassies or their mission to the UN (which is not uncommon at this point, according to Cutler). The government feels, however, that any potential problems would come from Libya, if at all, so will focus its efforts there. The UK is still trying to work out its best strategy for approaching the Government of Libya, whether through intelligence, diplomatic or other channels. The UK does not want to take any action regarding other governments until hearing back from the USG. No internal decision has been made as to whether the UK will request U.S. co-sponsorship, but an indication of whether we would be willing to do so if asked would be appreciated, said Cutler.

5.(SBU) Draft Text of UK Statement of Case: RESTRICTED/FOR RELEASE TO US ONLY THREE UK-BASED LIFG FINANCIERS The Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) is an Islamist extremist group formed in 1990 in the Afghanistan / Pakistan border area. The LIFG's original aim was to replace Colonel Gaddafi's regime with a hard-line Islamic state. In the 1990s, the LIFG mounted several operations inside Libya, including the 1996 attempt to assassinate Colonel Gaddafi. Following Libyan government action, which led to a number of LIFG members being killed or arrested, many LIFG members left Libya. On 3 November 2007, the LIFG formally merged with al-Qaida. The merger was announced through a Jihadist website affiliated with al-Qaida (the Al-Saheb media group). The merger was announced by two video clips; the first by al-Qaida second in command Ayman Al Zawahiri the second by Abu Laith Al Libi, who is a senior member of the LIFG and who is also a mujahidin trainer for al-Qaida in Afghanistan. The group is part of the al-Qaida movement that continues to threaten global peace and security. Accordingly, on 6 October 2001, the United Nations added LIFG to its consolidated list of entities associated with al-Qaida. The LIFG was proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK under the Terrorism Act 2000 with effect from 14 October 2005. LONDON 00000592 002.2 OF 003 The United Kingdom propose the following three LIFG members for designation according to UNSCR 1267. Through their conscious involvement with an entity that has associated with al-Qaida and its terrorist activities, these three LIFG members meet the criteria for designation by the al-Qaida and Taliban sanction Committee: IND

The details of the offence were that Kamoka, together with two other individuals "on or before 3 October 2005, entered into or became concerned in an arrangement as a result of which property was made available and was to be made available to others, knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that it would or might be used for the purposes of terrorism".
