¶B. THE HAGUE 271

Classified By: Political Counselor Andrew Schofer, reasons 1.4 (b,d)

¶1. (S) Summary: The GONL confirmed an attempted shipment of
tritium gas to Iran by a Dutch firm in December 2007.
According to MFA Senior Advisor for Nuclear Affairs and
Nonproliferation Ceta Noland, the Dutch are continuing to
investigate the incident and may pursue criminal charges
against the Dutch company. She said the Dutch have reported
the incident to the IAEA. Noland discussed these issues with
polmiloff on April 2. End summary.

¶2. (S) Per reftels, Noland compared notes on the halted
shipment of tritium gas at Schiphol International Airport in
December 2007. She said a Dutch firm had attempted to make
the shipment on behalf of its German parent company Campro
Scientific. The Dutch firm claimed the tritium gas was
intended -- in conjunction with leucine proteins -- to treat
blood disease at an Iranian children's hospital. Noland said
that such radioactive treatment is extremely experimental
in Europe, and Dutch authorities greatly doubted that Iranian
medical science had advanced to the point where such
treatment could be used on children. Given the radioactive
nature of the gas and end destination in Iran, the GONL
insisted the firm apply for an export license, which the firm
has yet to do.

¶3. (S) Noland said that while the shipment was halted, Dutch
authorities did not seize the tritium gas. She said the
Dutch suspect the tritium gas is still in the Netherlands, as
returning it to Germany would require a special license to
transport such a controlled item. Noland said the Dutch
continue to investigate the incident, including the
possibility of filing criminal charges against the Dutch
firm.

¶4. (S) Noland noted that cooperation with German authorities
has been excellent, and said that Campro Scientific had
attempted to make a similar shipment a year earlier from
Germany. She noted that both the German parent firm and
Dutch subsidiary have Iranian leadership, and said that
according to German authorities, the German director had been
arrested, while an Iranian diplomat associated with the
firm's activities had been expelled from Germany.

¶5. (S) Noland said the Dutch have reported the incident to
the IAEA so that it will be included in the illicit
trafficking database. She said the Dutch were interested in
making a NSG presentation on the incident, but have been
asked by Germany to postpone such a presentation due to the
on-going investigations in both Germany and the Netherlands.
