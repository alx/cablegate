SUBJECT: LIBYA FURTHER PRIVATIZES  FUEL DISTRIBUTION 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The Chairman of the Libya's National Oil Corporation 
(NOC), Shukri Ghanem, launched the country's third 
privately-owned fuel distribution company, al-Rahila, in a low 
profile ceremony at a newly refurbished filling station last 
week.  The al-Rahila Company is one of three companies 
established to participate in the privatization of fuel 
distribution in Libya; the other two are al-Sharara and the 
Libyan Company for Distribution of Petroleum Products.  Ghanem 
told local press the aim was to accelerate privatization and to 
improve the quality of service by introducing competition. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  The chairman of al-Rahila, Mohamed bin Hussain, told 
the press his company and two other firms emerged as a result of 
the restructuring of Braiga Oil Marketing Company.  Capitalized 
with 50 million Libyan dinars, al-Rahila currently owns 106 gas 
stations and is planning to build eight modern stations in 
various parts of the country.  According to Ghanem, NOC will 
continue to have a role in fuel distribution in Libya through 
the state-owned Braiga Company. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Comment: The launching of Libya's third 
privately-owned fuel distribution company marks another step in 
Libya's efforts to further privatize key sectors of its economy. 
 The GOL hopes that this process will contribute to more 
reliable fuel supplies and help mitigate any shortages (earlier 
this year Tripoli residents faced gas shortages due to delayed 
shipments of refined gasoline).  End comment.
