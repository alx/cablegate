SUBJECT: ICELAND SUPPORTS MOVING ISAF COUNTER-NARC DISCUSSION TO 
NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL 
 
Ref:  STATE 97395 
 
Classified by: Amb. Carol van Voorst for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) PolOff presented reftel points to Icelandic Ministry for Foreign 
Affairs Defense Counsellor Audunn Atlason on 11 September.  Atlason 
said Iceland would support moving the discussion on expanding ISAF's 
OPLAN to cover counternarcotics actions from the NATO Military 
Committee to the North Atlantic Council.  However, Atlason cautioned 
that Iceland would be unlikely to take a firm stance on the policy 
specifics, as Iceland does not have any military forces.  The MFA 
would prefer to leave the operational discussion to those with forces 
in theater, he noted.
