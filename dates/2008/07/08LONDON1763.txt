SUBJECT: HMG WILL JOIN U.S. IN DEMARCHING GOVERNMENTS TO 
RECOGNIZE KOSOVO; WILL PLEDGE GBP 23M 

REF: STATE 69691 1. (SBU) 

The UK concurs with the U.S. view that recent progress of Pristina government and international community stabilization efforts presents another opportunity to lobby those countries that have not already done so to recognize Kosovo's independence. FCO Balkans Deputy Director Adam Bye said that HMG would demarche the countries listed reftel and agreed that where appropriate, the U.S. and UK should do so together. He suggested that the decision on whether to demarche jointly be left to heads of missions in each country, based on conditions, effectiveness and receptivity of host governments. 

¶2. (U) Bye was pleased to hear that Director of Foreign Assistance Henrietta Fore was leading the U.S. delegation to the July 11 Kosovo Donors' conference in Brussels, and to learn of the expected USD 400M pledge. The UK lead at the conference will be DfID Director for Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, and Central, East and Northern Asia Sue Wardell. Bye confirmed that the UK pledge is expected to be GBP 23M (approx. 47 million USD) over the next three years, GBP 8M of which is to be allocated to general budget support through a multi-donor trust fund. The complete statement the UK will be tabling at the conference, including more details on donor coordination, has been emailed to EUR/WE, SCE and ACE.
