Recalling that it welcomed the announcement by the Ivorian 
authorities of the organization on 30 November 2008 of the 
first round of the presidential elections (S/PRST/2008/11) 
and that it encouraged the Ivorian parties to redouble 
their efforts to meet this commitment, and the 
international community to bring continued support to this 
effect,

continued efforts to support the peace process in Cote d' 
Ivoire, in particular through the Ouagadougou political

the continued efforts of the African Union and the 
Economic Community of West African States ("ECOWAS") to

Having taken note of the report of the Secretary-General
