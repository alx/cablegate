SUBJECT: LIBYA: TOTAL'S OFFSHORE OIL WELL SHUT DOWN 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  A recent drilling accident brought drilling 
and production operations in an offshore wellfield operated by 
French oil company TOTAL to a halt.  Although there were no 
injuries or environmental damage, production (the field produces 
about 45,000 barrels/day) will likely be halted for several 
months until the wells can be repaired.  Even if TOTAL 
subsequently surges production to recoup its losses, it will 
take several years to make up the lost production.  End Summary. 
 
DRILLING ACCIDENT 
 
¶2. (SBU)  In September 2003, French oil giant TOTAL started 
production in Libya's Al Jurf field, located about 100 
kilometers offshore in water averaging 90 meters in depth. The 
field consists of a platform with ten production wells connected 
to a floating production storage offloading (FPSO) vessel 
located roughly 3km from the producing platform.  Total operates 
the block with a 37.5% interest (via its local operating 
company, Mabruk Oil Operations) and is partnered with German oil 
company Wintershall (12.5% interest) and Libya's National Oil 
Corporation (50% interest). 
 
¶3. (SBU)  A drilling accident occurred at the field on April 17, 
during work on a development well for gas injection.  According 
to TOTAL's Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) manager, the 
drill went off-course and penetrated an adjacent production well 
at a depth of 650 feet beneath the seabed.  Due in part to the 
safety precautions taken before the commencement of drilling, 
including the shut-down of all production wells, there was no 
oil spillage or injuries as a result of the accident.  The 
entire platform was evacuated within 48 hours as an additional 
safety precaution against a well blowout, and production was 
suspended indefinitely in all ten wells in the field. 
 
OFFLINE FOR MONTHS...AT GREAT COST 
 
¶4. (SBU)  TOTAL's locally-based emergency team was activated to 
secure the platform, and a specialized ten-member technical team 
has been flown in from France to assess the damage and recommend 
a course of repairs.  Given the extent of the damage, the early 
assessment from the team is that the entire field will remain 
offline for at least two months.  That best case scenario 
involves making repairs from the platform itself, rather than 
from a relief well, which would have to be drilled alongside the 
damaged one.  If it becomes necessary to drill a relief well, 
the cost and timeline of needed repairs could expand 
considerably. 
 
¶5. (SBU)  The Al Jurf field is fairly large field, producing an 
average of 45,000 barrels/day. (Note: For sake of comparison, 
that is roughly the daily crude oil production of Turkey. End 
Note).  Loss of production for several months will make a 
significant dent in TOTAL's bottom line in Libya, and the NOC 
will likely seek compensation for the shortfall in their 
projected revenues.  TOTAL's HSE manager noted that once 
production is resumed, it could be surged to 52,000 barrels/day 
or more to compensate for the loss of production for several 
months.  Even at that rate, the gap would only be closed after a 
couple of years of uninterrupted production at the higher level. 
 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Comment: Although TOTAL has ably handled the 
aftermath, this is a major accident and a blot on its record in 
Libya.  Insurance will likely cover TOTAL for its losses in the 
short term and the continuing technical investigation may 
determine that repairs can be completed quickly; however, the 
tight market for offshore drilling ships could be a factor if it 
is determined that a relief well must be drilled to complete 
needed repairs.  End comment.
