the threat to the security and stability of Afghanistan 
posed by the Taliban, Al-Qaida, illegally armed groups, 
criminals and those involved in the narcotics trade; 
 
¶2. Recalling its resolutions 1267 (1999) and 1735 (2006), 
and reiterating its support for international efforts to 
combat terrorism in accordance with international law, 
including the Charter of the United Nations,

independence, territorial integrity and national unity of 
Afghanistan,

constitutional democracy and assume their rightful place 
in the community of nations, 
 
¶5. Noting with concern the existing links between 
international security and transnational organized crime, 
money-laundering, trafficking in illicit drugs and illegal 
arms, and in this regard emphasizing the need to enhance 
coordination of efforts on national, subregional, regional 
and international levels in order to strengthen a global 
response to this serious challenge [and threat to 
international security], 
 
¶6. Reiterating its concern about the security situation in 
Afghanistan, in particular the continued violent and 
terrorist activities by the Taliban, Al-Qaida, illegal 
armed groups, criminals and those involved in the 
narcotics trade, and the links between illicit drugs 
trafficking and the insurgency, 
 
¶7. Welcoming the ongoing efforts of the Government of 
Afghanistan in the fight against narcotic drugs and the 
efforts of neighboring countries to address the impact on 
the region of the production of illicit drugs in 
Afghanistan, including through interdiction activities, 
and encouraging the international and regional 
organizations to enhance their role in the fight against 
illicit trafficking in narcotics and precursors, 
 
¶8. Reiterating its support for the fight against illicit 
[production and] trafficking of drugs from and chemical 
precursors to Afghanistan, encouraging increased 
cooperation between Afghanistan, neighboring countries 
and countries on trafficking routes to strengthen 
anti-narcotics controls to curb the drug flow, including 
through border management cooperation, and expressing its 
support for the Paris Pact Initiative,  for the outcome of

Conference, 
 
¶9. Recalling that achieving a sustained and significant 
reduction in the production and trafficking of narcotics 
with a view to eliminating the narcotics industry has been 
identified as a cross-cutting priority by the "Afghanistan

framework for the partnership between the Afghan 
Government and the international community, as well as the 
Government of Afghanistan's National Drug Control 
Strategy, 
 
¶10. Stressing the importance of a comprehensive approach 
to address the drug problem of Afghanistan, which, to be 
effective has to be integrated into the wider context of 
efforts carried out in the three areas of Security, 
Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights, and economic and 
Social Development, stressing that the development of 
alternative livelihood programs is of key importance in 
the success of the efforts in counter-narcotics in

order to contribute to the sustainability of the 
elimination of illicit cultivation in Afghanistan,

smuggling for illicit use to and within Afghanistan of 
chemical precursors needed to produce heroin, in

most of the opium produced in Afghanistan is now processed 
in the country, 
 
¶12. Recalling the Political Declaration adopted by the

Member States, notably by providing technical assistance, 
in the fight against illicit drugs, 
 
¶1.        Expresses utmost concern at the high level of 
opium cultivation, production and trafficking, which
