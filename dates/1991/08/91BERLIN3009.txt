SUMMARY 
/------ 
 
¶1.  OFFICIAL UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE NEW GERMAN STATES ROSE A 
SHARP 27 PERCENT BETWEEN JUNE AND JULY TO A TOTAL OF 
1,068,000, OR ROUGHLY 12.1 PERCENT OF THE WORKFORCE. 
STILL, THE INCREASE DID NOT FULFILL SOME DIRE PREDICTIONS 
BASED ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE EXPIRATION ON JUNE 30 
OF "NO-FIRINGS" PROVISIONS IN KEY LABOR CONTRACTS AND OF 
SEVERANCE PROGRAMS FOR FORMER GDR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES.  A 
BROADER UNEMPLOYMENT INDICATOR, NAMELY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 
EASTERN GERMAN WORKERS EITHER UNEMPLOYED, WORKING ON A 
"SHORT-TIME" BASIS, OR ENROLLED IN GOVERNMENT "MAKE-WORK" 
PROGRAMS, REMAINED BASICALLY STABLE AT ONE-THIRD OF THE 
WORKFORCE.  MEANWHILE, THE GAP BETWEEN MALE UNEMPLOYMENT 
(9.8 PERCENT) AND FEMALE UNEMPLOYMENT (14.5 PERCENT) 
WIDENED FURTHER.  LOOKING TO THE FUTURE, FEDERAL LABOR 
OFFICE HEAD FRANKE, IN A BERLIN PRESS INTERVIEW, SUGGESTED 
THAT UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE NEW STATES COULD REACH 1.5 
MILLION BY YEAR'S END (OVER 16 PERCENT OF THE WORKFORCE), 
WITH TOTAL EMPLOYMENT IN THE NEW STATES FALLING FROM THE 
1989 GDR LEVEL OF APPROXIMATELY 9 MILLION TO ABOUT SIX 
MILLION.  END SUMMARY.

EXPECTED SHARP HIKE IN UNEMPLOYMENT ... 
/-------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  AFTER TWO MONTHS OF ALMOST STABLE UNEMPLOYMENT 
FIGURES, JULY PRODUCED THE EXPECTED SUBSTANTIAL 
END-OF-QUARTER HIKE.  ACCORDING TO THE LATEST FIGURES FROM 
THE BERLIN OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL LABOR AGENCY (RESPONSIBLE 
FOR COMPILING STATISTICS ON EASTERN BERLIN AND THE FIVE 
NEW STATES), UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE FROM 843,000 (9.5 PERCENT) 
IN JUNE TO 1,069,000 (12.1 PERCENT) IN JULY, AN ABSOLUTE 
INCREASE OF 226,000.  THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WORKERS INVOLVED 
IN "SHORT-TIME" WORK PROGRAMS FELL BY 283,000, FROM 
1,909,000 IN JUNE TO 1,615,000 IN JULY.  THE OVERVIEW 
TABLE BELOW SETS FORTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND SHORT-TIME WORKER 
STATISTICS FOR MAY THROUGH JULY 1991 (SHORT-TIME WORKER 
FIGURES FOR JULY REPRESENT MID-MONTH LEVELS).

¶3.  GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES IN UNEMPLOYMENT BECAME LESS 
DRAMATIC IN JULY.  THE LONG-TIME LEADER OF THE LIST, 
MECKLENBURG-VORPOMMERN, HAD THE SECOND SMALLEST INCREASE 
THIS MONTH (PLUS 2.0 PERCENT) AND WAS REPLACE BY EAST 
BERLIN IN THE NUMBER-ONE POSITION.  EAST BERLIN PROBABLY 
OWED ITS INCREASE OF 18,000 IN UNEMPLOYMENT TO ITS 
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF GDR-ERA GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES 
WHO WERE FINALLY TERMINATED AT THE END OF JUNE.  HOWEVER, 
EAST BERLIN MAINTAINED ITS EXTREMELY LOW PERCENTAGE OF

SHORT-TIME WORKERS AND WAS, THEREFORE, STILL IN THE BEST 
OVERALL POSITION OF ALL EASTERN STATES.  SAXONY CONTINUED 
TO ENJOY THE LOWEST LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT, ALTHOUGH IT 
SUFFERED THE HIGHEST NET INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT OF ALL 
(PLUS 2.8 PERCENT).  SAXONY-ANHALT AND THURINGIA REMAINED 
CLOSE TO AVERAGE IN UNEMPLOYMENT BUT LED THE LIST IN 
SHORT-TIME WORK; BRANDENBURG COMBINED AVERAGE 
UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES WITH A LOW SHORT-TIME WORKER TOTAL.

¶4.  IN JULY, THE NUMBER OF SHORT-TIME WORKERS IN THE NEW 
STATES SHRANK BY A RECORD 283,000.  THE IMPLICIT AMOUNT 
OF UNEMPLOYMENT HIDDEN IN THE SHORT-TIME WORK PROGRAM -- 
I.E., UNEMPLOYMENT CALCULATED USING THE PERCENTAGE OF 
TIME DURING WHICH EMPLOYEES WERE NOT WORKING -- DROPPED 
FROM 1,078,000, (12.3 PERCENT) TO 906,000 (10.3 
PERCENT).  THE DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHORT-TIMERS 
CLEARLY OUTPACED THE INCREASE IN THE RANKS OF THE NEWLY 
JOBLESS IN EVERY STATE.  BRANDENBURG REGISTERED THE BEST 
RATIO:  52,000 WORKERS ENDED SHORT-TIME WORK WITH ONLY 
35,000 ENTERING UNEMPLOYMENT.

TO PROGRESS IN JULY.  SOME 210,000 POSITIONS WERE FILLED 
BY THE END OF JULY, WHICH REPRESENTED 2.4 PERCENT OF THE

RESPECTIVE JUNE FIGURE.  THE USAGE OF ABM IS NOW COMING 
CLOSE TO THE FUNDING TARGET OF 280,000 POSITIONS, A 
NOTABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT TO KEEP 
UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES DOWN.

GOVERNMENT SPONSORED RETRAINING 
/------------------------------ 
 
¶9.  THE GOVERNMENT-FINANCED RETRAINING PROGRAM IS 
CERTAINLY AMONG THE MORE MINOR MEASURES AGAINST 
UNEMPLOYMENT BOTH IN TERMS OF FUNDING AND PARTICIPATION. 
HOWEVER, IN THE LONG TERM IT IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS GIVEN THE GOVERNMENT'S GOAL OF 
PROVIDING THE UN- AND UNDEREMPLOYED WITH THE SKILLS 
NECESSARY TO COMPETE IN THE CHANGING LABOR MARKET OF THE 
FUTURE.  THE PROGRAM HAS GROWN IN POPULARITY, WITH THE 
NUMBER OF NEW RETRAINING CONTRACTS RISING FROM 81,000 IN 
JUNE TO 96,000 IN JULY.  GIVEN THAT THERE ARE NO FIGURES 
AVAILABLE FOR THE TOTAL OF WORKERS ENROLLED IN RETRAINING 
PROGRAMS AT ANY ONE TIME, IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE 
PROGRESS TOWARD THE OFFICIAL TARGET OF 350,000 
RETRAINEES.  THE GOVERNMENT'S CURRENT EFFORT IN CREATING 
NEW CENTRALIZED MAKE-WORK ORGANIZATIONS 
(ARBEITSFOERDERUNGS- GESELLSCHAFTEN, ABS), DESIGNED TO 
COORDINATE THE CREATION OF ABM AS WELL AS OF RETRAINING

¶10.  TO OBTAIN A BROADER PICTURE OF THE OVERALL SITUATION 
IN THE EMPLOYMENT MARKET IN THE NEW STATES, IT IS USEFUL 
TO COMBINE FIGURES FROM THE UNEMPLOYMENT, SHORT-TIME 
WORK, AND ABM STATISTICS, FOLLOWING THE ASSUMPTION THAT 
ABM AND SHORT-TIME WORK ARE SIMPLY TWO MORE FACETS OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT.  ABM IN THE NEW STATES IS A PROGRAM 
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO KEEP THE UNEMPLOYED OFF THE 
DOLE, WHILE SHORT-TIME WORK PROGRAMS KEEP IDLE WORKERS 
WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS EVEN IF THE REASONS FOR THE WORK 
SHORTAGE ARE NOT TEMPORARY BUT STRUCTURAL.  IN THE 
CURRENT SITUATION, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE MAJORITY OF 
SHORT-TIME WORKERS AND ABM WORKERS WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS 
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAMS RUNS OUT.

JOB VACANCIES INCREASING 
/----------------------- 
 
¶12.  FIGURES FROM THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICES' JOB REFERRAL 
STATISTICS SUGGEST A POSITIVE TREND IN THE LABOR MARKET. 
SINCE FEBRUARY, THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY INCREASE IN THE 
NUMBER OF JOB VACANCIES REGISTERED WITH THE LABOR 
OFFICES, WITH THE JULY TOTAL OF 113,100 ALMOST FOUR TIMES 
THE COMPARABLE FEBRUARY OF 29,600.  IN JULY, LABOR 
OFFICES PLACED 95,900 PERSONS IN NEW JOBS, DOUBLE THE MAY 
PLACEMENT RATE.  HOWEVER, AS IN MAY, ROUGHLY TWO-THIRDS 
OF THESE NEW POSITIONS WERE IN ABM JOBS (IN JULY, 61,700 
OR 64 PERCENT OF NEW JOB PLACEMENTS WERE IN ABM JOB 
PROGRAMS). 
 
OTHER FACTORS TEMPERING UNEMPLOYMENT 
/----------------------------------- 
 
¶13.  MEANWHILE, THE WORKFORCE CONTINUES TO SHRINK.  THE 
FEDERAL LABOR OFFICE REPORTED THAT (AS OF JULY) SOME 
549,900 OLDER PERSONS HAD LEFT THE RANKS OF THE WORKING 
POPULATION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SPECIAL EARLY RETIREMENT 
PROGRAMS FOR UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE OVER 55 YEARS OLD.  THESE 
NUMBERS, IN ADDITION TO THE ROUGHLY 700,000 PERSONS WHO 
HAVE MOVED WESTWARD SINCE 1989, IMPLY AN ACTUAL WORK 
FORCE IN EASTERN GERMANY OF WELL UNDER 8.0 MILLION (THE 
OFFICIAL NUMBER IS STILL 8.87 MILLION).  WE NOTE COMMENTS 
BY FEDERAL LABOR OFFICE CHAIRMAN FRANKE, IN AN INTERVIEW 
IN THE AUGUST 12 EDITION OF "DER TAGESSPIEGEL,"

SUGGESTING THAT THE LABOR FORCE WILL HAVE DECLINED TO 
THIS RANGE BY DECEMBER, WITH SOME SIX MILLION PEOPLE 
EMPLOYED AND ANOTHER 1.5 MILLION ON THE JOBLESS ROLLS. 
 
DEMOGRAPHICS: WOMEN MORE LIKELY TO BE JOBLESS 
/-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶14.  THE JULY HIKE IN UNEMPLOYMENT WAS ESPECIALLY HARSH 
ON WOMEN.  WHILE MALE UNEMPLOYMENT ROSE FROM 8.0 TO 9.8 
PERCENT (UP 1.8 PERCENT), FEMALE UNEMPLOYMENT WENT UP 
FROM 11.2 TO 14.5 PERCENT (A JUMP OF 3.3 PERCENT). 
UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG WOMEN IS NOW ALMOST 50 PERCENT HIGHER 
THAN AMONG MEN.  SOME INCIDENTAL MATERIAL FROM THE

EMPLOYMENT STATISTICS INDICATES THAT WOMEN BELOW 25 YEARS 
OF AGE ARE LESS HARD HIT (13 PERCENT ABOVE MALE 
UNEMPLOYMENT) AND THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN UNEMPLOYMENT 
LEVELS INCREASES WITH AGE. 
 
COMMENT 
/------ 
 
¶15.  THE JULY UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES WERE PERHAPS MOST 
NOTABLE FOR THE FACT THAT THE INCREASE IN JOBLESSNESS WAS 
LESS THAN IT COULD HAVE BEEN:  A RISE OF "ONLY" 226,000. 
THIS WAS LESS THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE 770,000 
STILL-EMPLOYED WORKERS REGISTERED WITH THE FEDERAL 
EMPLOYMENT OFFICE FOR JOB REFERRAL, IN THE EXPECTATION, 
IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES, OF TERMINATION SOONER OR 
LATER.  WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND EXPIRED SHORT-TIME 
CONTRACTS AND A COMPARABLE NUMBER RELEASED FROM THE 
LONG-TERM SEPARATION PLAN FOR EX-GDR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES 
("WARTESCHLEIFE"), THE INCREASE OF UNEMPLOYMENT COULD, IN 
FACT, HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY HIGHER. 
 
¶16.  IN ADDITION, SEVERAL SOURCES, INCLUDING A SURVEY OF 
BERLIN AND BRANDENBURG COMPANIES, INDICATE THAT THE 
ACTUAL NUMBER OF TERMINATIONS AT THE END OF JUNE WAS 
ABOUT ONE-THIRD LOWER THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED.  ACCORDING 
TO PRESS ANALYSIS, MANY COMPANIES MAY HAVE DECIDED TO

WAIT FOR THE NEWLY PLANNED CENTRALIZED MAKE-WORK 
CORPORATIONS (ARBEITSFOERDERUNGSGESELLSCHAFTEN) TO COME 
INTO THEIR OWN, WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR AN EASIER 
TRANSITION FROM SHORT-TIME WORK TO ABM AND RETRAINING FOR 
LARGE NUMBERS OF EMPLOYEES.  UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, 
THE INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT CAN THEREFORE BE EXPECTED TO 
BE MODEST.  IN HIS "DER TAGESSPIEGEL" INTERVIEW, FEDERAL 
LABOR OFFICE CHAIRMAN FRANKE SPOKE OF A 12 PERCENT 
AVERAGE LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN 1991 (WITH THE 
IMPLICATION THAT, GIVEN LOWER FIGURES IN THE FIRST HALF 
YEAR, UNEMPLOYMENT FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR WOULD AVERAGE 
OVER 14 PERCENT) WITH JOBLESS TOTALS REACHING 1.5 MILLION 
OR 16.9 PERCENT BY DECEMBER.  STILL, THE EXPECTED 
INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT COULD BE MATCHED BY A DECREASE 
IN SHORT-TIME WORK, MEANING THAT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 
WORKERS AFFECTED BY UNEMPLOYMENT, SHORT-TIME WORK, OR ABM 
WOULD REMAIN MORE-OR-LESS STABLE.  MUCH DEPENDS ON 
GOVERNMENT DECISIONS ON A POSSIBLE FURTHER EXTENSION OF 
THE REMAINING SHORT-TIME PROGRAMS AND ON PROGRESS MADE BY 
THE CENTRALIZED MAKE-WORK CORPORATIONS.  LOOKING TOWARD 
NEXT YEAR, JANUARY TERMINATIONS COULD AGAIN BE 
SUBSTANTIAL, SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE, WITH A GENERAL 
TURN-AROUND IN THE LABOR MARKET NOT EXPECTED BEFORE LATER 
IN 1992, LAGGING SOMEWHAT ANY GENERAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
IN THE NEW STATES.  MILES
