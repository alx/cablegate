SUBJECT:  TFIZO1: FAO SAYS PRESS MISREPRESENTED VIEWS ON 
IRAQ FOOD SITUATION 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  MISOFFS CONTACTED THE UN FOOD AND 
AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) REGARDING RECENT PRESS 
REPORTS CONVEYING ALLEGED FAO CONCERN REGARDING THE FOOD 
SITUATION AND THE PROSPECT OF "STARVATION" IN IRAQ. 
LAURENT THOMAS, CHIEF OF SPECIAL EMERGENCY PROGRAMS, SAID 
THAT THE FAO'S VIEWS WERE MISREPRESENTED: FAO DOES NOT 
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT "STARVATION" IN IRAQ.  FAO BELIEVES 
THAT THE FOOD SITUATION IS BEING WELL HANDLED AND THERE 
IS NO RISK OF DETERIORATION IN FOOD SECURITY.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) ON MAY 11, 2003, THE GUARDIAN (UK) REPORTED THAT 
    THE FAO BELIEVES THAT IRAQI AGRICULTURE IS ON THE "BRINK 
OF COLLAPSE" AND MANY OF IRAQ'S PEOPLE WILL "GO HUNGRY 
THIS SUMMER."  A MAY 12 STORY ON THE BLOOMBERG WIRE 
SERVICE REPORTED FAO'S CHIEF OF SPECIAL EMERGENCY 
PROGRAMS, LAURENT THOMAS, AS SAYING THE FAO IS "VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT IRAQ'S FOOD PRODUCTION CAPACITIES FOR 
BOTH THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM."  HOWEVER, THE ARTICLE DID 
NOTE THAT THOMAS DOWNPLAYED THE POSSIBILITY OF A HUNGER 
CRISIS IN IRAQ. 
 
¶3. (SBU) TO MISSION OFFICERS, THOMAS INDICATED THAT THE 
GUARDIAN ARTICLE SOUGHT TO SENSATIONALIZE AND RELIED UPON 
A JUNIOR FAO STAFF MEMBER IN CYPRUS.  THOMAS SAID HIS 
COMMENTS TO BLOOMBERG WERE MEANT TO CORRECT THE RECORD. 
THOMAS EXPRESSED REGRET THAT FAO VIEWS HAD BEEN 
MISPORTRAYED, AND NOTED HE HAS SINCE BEEN DESIGNATED THE 
SOLE SPOKESPERSON FOR FAO ON IRAQ TO TRY TO AVOID SUCH 
STORIES IN THE FUTURE. 
 
¶4. (SBU) THOMAS ELABORATED THAT FAO AND THE UN WORLD FOOD 
PROGRAM (WFP) ARE ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH IN TERMS OF 
THEIR ASSESSMENT OF THE IRAQI FOOD SITUATION:  THE FOOD 
SITUATION IS BEING WELL HANDLED AND, IN LIGHT OF THE RE- 
ACTIVATION OF THE PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, THERE IS NO 
RISK THE FOOD SECURITY SITUATION WILL DETERIORATE.  FAO 
AND WFP ARE SHARING INFORMATION AND ARE JOINTLY PLANNING 
A CROP AND FOOD ASSESSMENT MISSION THE FIRST WEEK IN 
JUNE, WHEN SECURITY IS EXPECTED TO ALLOW ACCESS FOR THE 
TEAM AND THE HARVEST WILL BE ONGOING.  TAMLYN
