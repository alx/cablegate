SUBJECT: INDEPENDENT PAPER PRAISES COURT DECISION ON 
MEDIA CONTROL LAW 
 
  ¶1.   Under headline "A step in the right direction" 
      the independent daily "The Daily News" dedicated its 
      May 9 editorial to hailing a recent Supreme Court 
      ruling that annulled two sections of the Access to 
      Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) 
      impinging on press freedom.  Excerpts follow: 
 
  ¶2.   "All right-thinking Zimbabweans must applaud the 
      Supreme Court's bold decision to strike down as 
      unconstitutional Section 80 (1) (b) and (2) of 
      the government's Soviet-style Access to 
      Information and Protection of Privacy Act 
      (AIIPA).  That a government in this day and age 
      could even think of enacting a law that 
      virtually criminalizes journalism, as the AIPPA 
      clause struck down by the court did, is 
      reprehensible in any democracy.  Even one as 
      dubious as Zimbabwe. . .  And we urge the 
      judiciary to continue the commendable process it 
      has begun and nullify one-by-one the various 
      provisions of AIPPA that militate against media 
      freedom. . ."
