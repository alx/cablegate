On May 14, POLMIL Counselor delivered reftel points to Deputy 
Director General for Middle East Affairs Safak Gokturk. 
Gokturk said that the Iraqi Ambassador had already departed 
Turkey.  Gokturk then noted that, while Turkey will not 
recognize the remaining Iraqi staff as having any diplomatic 
or consular authority and responsibility, it will be 
difficult to safeguard diplomatic materials, such as files, 
consular seals and accounts, etc.  Nevertheless, Gokturk 
assured us that Turkey will do its best to implement the 
Steering Committee's guidance.
