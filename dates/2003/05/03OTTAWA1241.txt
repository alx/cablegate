Canada supports the U.S. position on both the classification 
of Fanta Beverage base in subheading 3302.10 and the 
opposition to the introduction into the legal text of any 
quantitative criteria for use in the classification of 
sauces, according to the Senior Policy Advisor for 
International Nomenclature Development at the Canada Customs 
and Revenue Agency Tom MacDonald.  Mr. MacDonald will 
represent Canada at the May meeting of the Harmonized System 
Committee in Brussels.  He is filling in for Canada's usual 
delegate, Ignatius Leron, who has been temporarily assigned 
other responsibilities.
