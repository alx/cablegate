SUBJECT: VISA CARD OFFICIAL SEEKS CONTACTS IN BAGHDAD 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Visa Jordan, a subsidiary of Visa International, 
has sent a staff member to Baghdad to work with Iraqi 
businesses to enable them to accept Visa credit and debit 
card payments.  Under the system, a limited number of Iraqi 
businesses would be able to accept such payments, 
authorization would be obtained by a satellite telephone link 
to Visa Jordan, and paperwork would be couriered daily 
between Amman and Baghdad by road.  Visa Jordan is working 
closely with Visa International and Visa headquarters in San 
Francisco to iron out the logistical and legal details. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Visa thought that U.S. government personnel in 
Baghdad, particularly those using Government credit cards 
might have a particular interest in seeing such a system up 
and running.  Mr. Tareq Nasser, the Visa Jordan official is 
staying at the Sumerland Hotel and can be reached on Thuraya 
number 882-166-322-0223.  He would be happy to meet and 
discuss this subject with U.S. representatives.
