¶2.  Radikal/Milliyet: The police and jandarma 
have been alerted to arrest seven contractors of 
the buildings that collapsed and killed many 
people during the earthquake in Bingol on May 1. 
Pictures of the wanted contractors have been 
distributed to the security officials, and a 
warrant of arrest has been issued for the 
contractors. Hurriyet reports that under the "Do 
not let our schools collapse" campaign initiated 
by Hurriyet Paper and Channel-D, a delegation of 
eight experts from Middle East Technical 
University started examining the schools in 
Bingol by taking samples of concrete for 
analyzing in their labs in Ankara. 
 
 
¶3.  Milli Gazete: The earthquake victims in 
Bingol are afraid to go into their damaged 
houses. Three families are staying in one tent in 
Bingol's Asagikoy village with 81 houses, 500 
inhabitants. The villagers were afraid to go into 
their houses because of aftershocks, and only 25 
tents have been issued to their village with 81 
houses. The village headman, Abdulkerim Boztimur, 
said 20 persons were staying in one tent and 
asked for more tents rather than any relief 
material or foodstuff. Bingol Governor, Huseyin 
Avni Cos, announced that they delivered 13 
thousand tents and 400 tons of foodstuffs in 
Bingol to date.
