¶1. (U) SUMMARY:  The GODR MFA has confirmed that former 
Ecuadorian President Gustavo Noboa arrived in the Dominican 
Republic on August 23 after being granted approval by the GOE 
to travel.  He and his spouse have been staying at the 
Presidential retreat, but are arranging to rent their own 
apartment here.  The document granting Noboa safe passage 
states that the GOE retains the right to request Noboa's 
extradition.  Noboa had been living in GODR diplomatic 
residences in Ecuador since July 28 when he first petitioned 
for asylum.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U) MFA Americas Director Francia Sencion has confirmed to 
us that former Ecuadorian President Gustavo Noboa was granted 
asylum by the GODR and arrived in the Dominican Republic 
August 23.  Noboa and his wife, Maria Isabel Baquerizo, were 
met by Presidential security at Las Americas airport and 
taken directly to the Presidential retreat in Juan Dolio, 
where they met with President Mejia.  The Ecuadorians have 
been staying there briefly as Mejia,s guests and are in 
process of renting a &small8 apartment here, within their 
limited finances. 
 
¶3. (U) Noboa had been living in GODR diplomatic residences in 
Ecuador while awaiting the GOE's decision on whether it would 
allow him to travel to the Dominican Republic.  The GOE 
granted Noboa's request to leave the country, but retained 
the right to request Noboa's extradition in the event an 
Ecuadoran court subpoenas him.  However, Sencion said the 
GODR does not consider this hypothetical extradition to be a 
condition of the safe-conduct. 
 
¶4. (U) All Santo Domingo dailies covered the arrival of the 
Noboa, noting that Presidential security forces would not 
allow them access to Ex-President Noboa on orders from the 
Presidential Palace. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: The arrival of Noboa comes in the same week 
in which President Mejia announced his support for a bill 
which would grant immunity from criminal prosecution to 
former Dominican presidents.  So far there has been no 
linking of the two events in the press.
