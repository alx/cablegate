  ¶1.   Under headline "NAM opposes war on Iraq" the 
      pro-government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" 
      dedicated its February 23 editorial to 
      embracing the Non Aligned Movement's (NAM) anti- 
      war position against Iraq.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .The Non Aligned Movement. . .has already 
      stated that it will oppose the American and British- 
      led war on Iraq. . .  The attitude by NAM gives the 
      world an additional ray of hope, coming as it is at a 
      time world mass opinion, a superpower in itself, is 
      gaining greater momentum against the its verbal 
      nobility into a pro-active crusade against the 
      murderers of peace."
