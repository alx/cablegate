BRIEFING 
Turkey-U.S. Talks on PKK/KADEK: Weekend papers report that 
Turkish and US officials met on Friday to discuss PKK/KADEK 
presence in Northern Iraq.  In a statement after the seven- 
hour long session, Lynn Pascoe, the head of the US 
delegation, announced that both sides agreed on a joint 
action plan against PKK/KADEK. However, in the Foreign 
Ministry Statement, there was no reference to an action 
plan.  Saturday's "Cumhuriyet" notes that the parties had 
agreed to continue talks about the details.  Saturday's 
"Sabah" reports that US forces in Northern Iraq will exert 
pressure on PKK/KADEK militants in Northern Iraq to 
surrender to Turkey.  If the militants refuse to surrender, 
then, Turkey and the US will carry out a joint operation 
against the terrorist organization.  Saturday's "Zaman" 
reports that the details of the operation will be worked out 
during talks in October and that the operation will be 
carried out in November.  Sunday's papers report that talks 
between Turkish and US officials over PKK/KADEK did not 
produce satisfactory results. 
 
 
Ambassador Edelman Visits TOBB:  Saturday's "Hurriyet" 
covers Ambassador Edelman's visit to Rifat Hisarciklioglu, 
the chairman of Turkish Union of Chambers and the Commodity 
Exchanges.  Responding to a question whether the $8.5 
billion US credit had a troop deployment condition or not, 
Ambassador Edelman was quoted as saying that `the credit, 
first of all, depends on the success of Turkey's economic 
program, and then on the cooperation in Iraq. 
 
 
New Education Draft:  Today's papers focus on the meeting of 
Land Forces Commander General Aytac Yalman with the 
president of the Higher Education Board (YOK) and eight 
university presidents.  "Radikal" reports that in a 
statement yesterday the General Staff had confirmed the 
reports of Yalman-YOK officials.  The statement stressed 
that the General Staff was aware of the meeting and that it 
is natural for the military to follow the developments in 
the education system.  "Sabah" reports that the government 
was receptive to the demands of the General Staff regarding 
the new YOK draft. 
 
 
 
 
EDITORIAL OPINION 
 
 
"Through Sunni eyes" 
Asli Aydintasbas observed in mass appeal Sabah (9/15): "A 
week in Baghdad has shown me that things on the Eastern 
Front are not that bad. .  Shiites, Kurds and the Turkomen 
are happy with the removal of Saddam.  Turkey should not 
base its policy on Sunnis alone when planning its relations 
with Iraq in future. .  There is an ongoing fight over 
sovereignty between the Iraqi interim governing council and 
the Americans.  The commission entrusted with writing the 
new Iraqi constitution is not working in line with the 
Americans' preference. .  Fallujah and neighboring areas, 
the region being considered for Turkish troops is still 
insecure.  Attacks against U.S. soldiers in this area are 
neither a sign of resistance by the Iraqis against 
outsiders, nor assaults by Saddam's supporters.  It is a 
blood feud between the regional people and U.S. troops. 
After each Iraqi is killed by the panicky Americans, 
hundreds of Iraqis vow for vengeance. .  American or Turkish 
troops cannot work out a solution for Fallujah.  The town 
must be left to the Iraqis at once."
