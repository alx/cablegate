¶1.     Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation Agnes van 
Ardenne announced at the September 21 Dubai international

Afghan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF).  Ms. Marit van

also provide a small amount of bilateral funding to a handful 
of select projects (ref B) in Afghanistan, but the MFA has 
not released any details.
