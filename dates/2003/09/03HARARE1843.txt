  ¶1.   Under headline "Americans to mark grim anniversary" 
      United States-based columnist for the government 
      controlled weekly "The Sunday Mail" (09/07), Tendayi 
      Kumbula, dedicated his article to reflect on the 
      second anniversary of September 11, 2001 terrorist 
      attacks in the United States.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "On Thursday they will be observing a grim anniversary 
      throughout the U. S. A.  It is the second anniversary of 
      September 11, 2001. . .Life has never been the same in the 
      ¶U. S. since the twin terror attacks claimed hundreds of 
      lives at the World Trade Center twin towers. . .and at the 
      Pentagon. . .On Thursday morning, Americans in various ways 
      will mark that grim anniversary.  President George W. Bush 
      has proclaimed that flags should be flown at half-staff in 
      honor of the dead.  Churches are organizing services and 
      prayers. . .But underlying all this is concern about why it 
      happens, what it means and whether it could happen again. 
      There is a palpable level of nervousness that comes from 
      knowing when and where the terrorists will strike again. 
      That concern was underlined by a Federal Bureau of 
      Investigation warning issued on Friday about a terrorist 
      threat. . .So, as Thursday rolls around, Americans will try 
      to act normal.  But there is little doubt that the terror 
      attacks have altered American lifestyles."
