black ribbons all day yesterday to show their 
respect for the lost lives in the September 11,

share the grief of the U.S Government and the 
American people. 
 
 
¶4. Turkiye / The Turkish Government is planning to 
open the Ovakoy border gate between Syria and

officials.  The plan includes canceling all the 
trade at Habur border gate, which is now under 
the control of Kurdish peshmerges, and using

accepted the Habur gate will only be used for 
the transport of humanitarian aid and the 
dispatch of troops.

investigation of the incident.

struck by an earthquake in May, 2003, needs

previous school buildings requires financial 
aid and assistance.
