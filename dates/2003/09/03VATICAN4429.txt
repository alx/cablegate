SUBJECT: CUBA STEPPING UP PRESSURE ON CATHOLIC CHURCH 
 
REF: VATICAN 1775 
 
¶1. (SBU) "FIDEL CASTRO SEES THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS AN 
ENEMY," HAVANA'S CARDINAL JAIME ORTEGA ASSERTED IN 
DESCRIBING CHURCH-STATE RELATIONS ON THE COMMUNIST ISLAND 
DURING A RECENT VISIT TO ITALY.  INTERVIEWED BY ITALIAN 
    BISHOPS' DAILY "AVVENIRE," THE CARDINAL SUMMARIZED THE 
CHURCH'S SITUATION IN CUBA AS BEING "UNDER SIEGE."  HE 
SPOKE OF A "SUBTLE BATTLE AGAINST THE CHURCH, WHICH IS SEEN 
AS A PRIVATE ENTITY TO BE MARGINALIZED SO AS NOT TO ROB THE 
REVOLUTION OF ITS STRENGTH AND ENERGY."  THE CARDINAL'S 
COMMENTS ARE IN LINE WITH RECENT COMMENTS WE HAVE HEARD 
FROM THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE, WHICH HAS SHOWN INCREASING 
IRRITATION WITH THE REPRESSIVE ACTIONS OF THE CUBAN 
GOVERNMENT.  SPEAKING ABOUT CUBA IN A RECENT MEETING, THE 
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID: "ENOUGH IS 
ENOUGH." 
 
¶2. (U)  CARDINAL ORTEGA, IN ITALY FOR A "SISTER CITY" 
EVENT, SAID THAT ALTHOUGH POPE JOHN PAUL II'S 1998 VISIT TO 
CUBA HAD GENERATED A POSITIVE SPIN-OFF FOR THE CHURCH, THIS 
WAS LIMITED TO THE SOCIAL LEVEL.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE VISIT 
HAD HELPED FACILITATE THE WORK OF CATHOLIC RELIEF AGENCY 
CARITAS, AND THE CHURCH'S CARE FOR THE SICK AND POOR. 
 
¶3. (U) ORTEGA SPOKE OF A WIDESPREAD DESIRE AMONG CUBANS TO 
EMIGRATE, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNG.  WHEN ASKED IF 
DIALOGUE WITH THE CASTRO REGIME WAS POSSIBLE, THE CARDINAL 
QUOTED FROM ONE OF THE POPE'S SPEECHES IN HAVANA - "ONLY 
DIALOGUE WILL RESOLVE DIFFICULTIES".  ORTEGA INDICATED THAT 
HE WOULD PURSUE THIS STRATEGY "EVEN IF PROBLEMATIC". 
 
¶4. (U) "AVVENIRE" REPORTED ON THE SAME PAGE A RECENT CUBAN 
BISHOPS' DOCUMENT THAT LAMENTS THE REGIME'S IDEOLOGICAL 
RETURN TO THE EARLY DAYS OF THE REVOLUTION WITH ITS 
CONCURRENT OPPRESSIVE ANTI-CATHOLICISM.   OF GREATEST 
CONCERN TO THE PRELATES HOWEVER WAS THE SENSE OF 
    HOPELESSNESS AMONG ORDINARY CUBANS, ALONG WITH THE DAILY 
STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND A RESULTING DESIRE TO 
EMIGRATE. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  CARDINAL ORTEGA'S REMARKS REFLECT THE 
CONTINUING DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE CUBAN CHURCH OVER THE LACK 
OF MOVEMENT SINCE POPE JOHN PAUL II'S "HOPE FILLED" 1998 
VISIT.  ORTEGA IS A REALIST -- THUS HIS CONTINUING 
PREFERENCE FOR DIALOGUE TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE IDEOLOGICAL 
CHASM BETWEEN COMMUNISM AND CATHOLICISM.  WHILE THE HOLY 
SEE ITSELF OFFICIALLY PROMOTES A SIMILAR COURSE OF 
ENGAGEMENT, THE POPE'S FORCEFUL CONDEMNATION OF CASTRO'S 
APRIL EXECUTIONS AND DETENTIONS, AND HIS PROMOTION OF 
DEMOCRACY FOR THE ISLAND (REFTEL) INDICATE THE VATICAN'S 
OWN DEEPENING FRUSTRATION WITH THE CUBAN REGIME AND ITS 
RECENT ACTIONS.  FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, THE VATICAN IS 
LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO AUGMENT THE CHURCH'S SOCIAL PRESENCE 
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CUBAN PEOPLE WHILE ALSO PROTESTING 
DETENTIONS DIRECTLY WITH THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT AND SPEAKING 
OUT AS OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR 
OPPOSITION TO CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES.
