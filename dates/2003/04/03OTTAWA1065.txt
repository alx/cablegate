TAGS: PREL IZ CA
SUBJECT: IRAQI EMBASSY IN CANADA 
 
REF: (A) STATE 93783 (B) OTTAWA 801 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Brian Flora, 
Reasons 1.5 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (S) We discussed reftel (A) demarche with Chris Hull, 
Foreign Affairs Desk Officer for Iraq, on April 11.  Hull 
told us that the GoC continues to monitor closely the 
activities of the one Iraqi diplomat remaining in country, 
Charge Mamdouh Mustafa, and had no indication that he was 
destroying Iraqi Government records or property.  Hull noted 
that the GoC was looking for an opportunity to remove items 
of an "undiplomatic nature" (nfi) from the premises of the 
Iraqi Embassy. 
 
¶2. (S) Mustafa, Hull continued, has given no indication of 
his future plans.  Hull saw no basis for him to be granted 
refugee status, but said that if Mustafa makes such a claim 
he could remain in Canada while his case is being reviewed. 
The GoC could also decide to declare him persona non grata. 
The RCMP is providing security for the Iraqi Embassy and is 
escorting Mustafa due to concerns about potential 
demonstrators. 
 
¶3. (S) COMMENT: The GoC has been very helpful to us in 
working with Mustafa, and we have concurred with their 
reasons for not expelling him from Canada (ref. B).  The GoC 
is now taking a wait-and-see approach on how to deal with 
him.  The Foreign Affairs spokesperson has said it would be 
up to the new Iraqi Government to decide whether to withdraw 
current diplomats.
