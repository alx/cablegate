SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION WAR WITH IRAQ; HARARE 
 
 
  ¶1.   Under headline "What liberation?" the pro- 
      government weekly "The Sunday Mirror" dedicated its 
      April 6 editorial to condemning the United States-led 
      war against Iraq, charging that the war is "creating 
      untold hardships" for the Iraqis.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .Adamantly sticking to their self-serving 
      perceptions as liberators of the people of 
      Iraq, rather than the invaders that they are, 
      the Americans and their allies have pushed into 
      the Iraqi capital, where they have bombed out 
      critical public amenities, creating untold 
      hardships for the people they claim to have 
      come to liberate. . .  President Bush openly 
      admitted to the American public that this could 
      be a long war.  This means that the longer it 
      takes, the more suffering that would be visited 
      upon the people of Iraq.  It, therefore, 
      defeats logic that Bush should announce the 
      imminent `liberation' of the Iraqis when, in 
      fact, they are set to suffer more hardships 
      under Anglo-American occupation."
