  ¶1.   Under headline "U.N. must stop murder of innocent 
      civilians" the government-controlled daily "Chronicle" 
      used its April 4 editorial to label President Bush and 
      Tony Blair as "the real terrorists."  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .It is sad that the American and British 
      invasion forces have taken it upon themselves to kill 
      civilians under the guise of pursuing democracy.  What 
      democracy?  America is clearly after the resources of 
      the Iraqi people and this is further heightened by the 
      threats now being made on Iran and Syria.  We believe 
      that the world cannot stand by and watch the senseless 
      massacre of women and children by lunatics who have 
      been allowed to hold weapons of mass destruction.  It 
      is our view that the people who should be targeted for 
      persecution in pursuit of peace in the world are the 
      real terrorists - George Bush and his Chihuahua, Tony 
      Blair.  We want to know where the United Nations is 
      while all this is happening.  Members of the U.N. 
      cannot be held to ransom by two countries that enjoy 
      stronger economies. The world body has failed in its 
      role as a watchdog. . ."
