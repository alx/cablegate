¶1.  (U)  This is an action message.  Please see 
paragraph three. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Amcit Farhan Bakir, a prominent doctor in 
the UAE (he is the personal physician of Abu Dhabi 
Crown Prince Shaykh Khalifa bin Zayid Al-Nahyan and 
served in a similar capacity to a number of Saddam 
Hussein's predecessors), met with PolChief 4/21 to ask 
how Iraqi expat doctors could be integrated into the 
ongoing relief effort in Iraq.  Bakir is well known in 
Iraqi expat political circles, having been invited to 
serve on the medical committee focus group which met 
in Washington.  A cardio-pulmonary specialist, he said 
that he is in contact with a number of fellow expat 
Iraqi doctors, many of them American citizens living 
in the UAE, who would like to volunteer to travel to 
Iraq to help the humanitarian effort.  These doctors 
speak Arabic, are familiar with the Iraqi health 
system, and would be available to deploy on short 
notice.  We estimate that there are at least ten 
doctors who would be available for this activity, 
possibly more.  Bakir asked for guidance on modalities 
and perceived usefulness of such an effort, before 
proceeding further with it. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  COMMENT AND ACTION REQUEST:  We believe 
that Bakir's group could provide meaningful 
assistance.  They realize that Baghdad may be becoming 
saturated and would be willing to serve elsewhere, 
particularly in Southern Iraq.  Beyond the very real 
practical benefit that these doctors could provide, 
the optics of our facilitating this effort strike us 
as highly beneficial.  We would appreciate guidance 
from the appropriate addressees as to how we should 
respond to Bakir's inquiry.
