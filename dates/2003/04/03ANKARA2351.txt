Poloff April 11 delivered reftel points to Omer Tuzel, head 
of the MFA OSCE Department.  Tuzel said the GOT in the past 
has been represented by its Permrep at one- or two-day OSCE 
meetings.  He said it would be difficult for the GOT to send 
a larger delegation to the Anti-Semitism Meeting under 
current austerity measures, though he did not rule it out. 
He said he will inform Embassy when the GOT determines who 
will represent it at the meeting.
