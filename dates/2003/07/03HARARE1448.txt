  ¶1.   Under headline "Liars like Bush annihilate themselves" 
      the ruling ZANU-PF weekly mouthpiece "The People's Voice" 
      dedicated its July 13 editorial to criticizing the United 
      States policy towards Zimbabwe.  Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .Since when (has) Britain and the U. S. started 
      caring for the human rights of Zimbabweans. . .The 
      ¶U. S. and Britain waged a war for regime change in 
      Iraq in order to have monopoly over that country's 
      oil.  Now they are shifting their attention to 
      Zimbabwe, which they would like to rule through 
      pseudo democracy. . .The reason being touted to the 
      world in Zimbabwe is that there are human rights 
      violations when infact these two western leaders 
      (President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister 
      Tony Blair) are against black ownership of 
      land. . .The calls for regime change in Zimbabwe are 
      aimed at achieving the reversal of the land reform 
      program so that Western individuals and institutions 
      have direct and indirect control of the 
      resource. . .Bush and Blair should be reminded that 
      whatever they do, Zimbabwe will always and forever 
      be for Zimbabweans. . . ."
