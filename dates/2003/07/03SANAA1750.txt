REF: STATE 186973 
 
PolOff briefed MFA Director Al-Awadi on the upcoming UNGA 
cloning debate and reiterated the U.S. position against the 
cloning of human embryos (reftel) on July 16.  PolOff and 
Awadi reviewed the Costa Rican draft resolution at length, 
and discussed the inadequacies of the French-German proposal. 
 Awadi will forward the information to relevant parties, 
including MFA's International Organizations Office, but 
remained non-committal on ROYG support for Costa Rica's 
resolution.
