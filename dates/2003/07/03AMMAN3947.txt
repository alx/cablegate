SUBJECT:  IRAQI BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN JORDAN MEETS CPA 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  FOR USG DISTRIBUTION ONLY. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary.  In a meeting with CPA advisors 
visiting Jordan, a group of Amman-based Iraqi business 
people said that they controlled substantial capital and 
technical resources that they wanted to contribute to the 
reconstruction of Iraq.  In order to facilitate 
communication with the authority in Iraq, they are 
planning to form an association of expatriate Iraqi 
investors.  Among the first things they would call for 
was political risk cover for commercial investments in 
Iraq, at least until new Iraqi commercial and legal 
institutions are up and running.  Although we do not know 
much about the background of the individual 
businesspeople, it could be useful to keep up a dialogue 
with them to see what they have to offer.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  On June 24, following the World Economic Forum 
meetings at the Dead Sea, a group of Jordan-based Iraqi 
businesspeople met CPA economic advisors Reuben Jeffery 
and Eric Otto at the Intercontinental Hotel in Amman. 
Embassy Amman economic and commercial staff also sat in 
on the meeting, which was facilitated by Jordanian 
businessman Husam Deranieh.  The businessmen were Iraqis 
who said they have been resident in Jordan for many years 
but who retained business and personal interests in Iraq 
and continued to do business there under the UN Oil for 
Food Program and the bilateral Jordan-Iraq trade 
protocol.  The businessmen said that they were interested 
in working with CPA to become active in investing and 
trading in Iraq. 
 
------------------------ 
Difficulty Communicating 
------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The group's main concern was an inability to 
establish clear lines of communication with CPA to 
discuss investment and business opportunities.  For 
example, they had variously tried to be in touch to offer 
assistance in providing catering and duty-free services 
at BIAP or to quickly set up a 50,000 line wireless 
telecom network in the Basra area.  While their initial 
email messages or phone calls were acknowledged, there 
had been little to no follow-up from CPA. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  The Iraqis said that they had been more 
successful in establishing working relationships with 
local coalition military commanders on the ground.  This 
had allowed them to start up some local activities that 
affected Iraqi citizens' lives on a small scale. 
However, these businessmen said that they had the 
financial capacity and know-how to operate on a national 
scale.  They said they had represented U.S. companies, 
had technical skills, large pools of potential employees, 
as well as the connections necessary to guarantee 
security (see bio information below). 
 
------------------------------------------ 
An Expatriate Iraqi Investors Association? 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Jeffery described plans to establish a 
business help center in Baghdad in the near future that 
could serve as an initial point of contact.  The 
businessmen said they were planning to organize 
themselves as an association of expatriate Iraqi 
businesspeople that could deal on members' behalf with 
CPA and Iraqi ministries.  They said business 
associations in Iraq with which CPA appeared to be 
already communicating (such as the Iraqi Businessmen's 
Association) were tainted by association with the former 
regime. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  The group also said that as expatriate Iraqis 
resident in Jordan, they would be well-accepted by the 
Iraqi people.  They said that CPA appeared to be dealing 
with Kuwaiti and Gulf businesspeople, which most Iraqis 
would find offensive.  For instance, the businessman who 
said he had offered to set up a mobile phone network in 
Basra in three weeks (Dr. al-Sadi), had been disheartened 
to learn that a Kuwaiti company had been selected to do a 
similar job.  A few major projects with Iraqi business 
participation would, they thought, go a long way to 
bolster the Coalition's image among Iraqis. 
 
----------------- 
Looking for Cover 
----------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  The businessmen said that they were ready to 
take financial and business risk in investing and trading 
in Iraq.  However, they felt that there was a necessary 
role for the types of political risk cover provided by 
institutions like the International Finance Corporation 
and OPIC.  Such guarantees would be especially important, 
they said, until new financial and legal institutions 
were established in Iraq.  They said official export 
credits would also be very helpful in providing Iraqi 
businesspeople with the resources to finance imports.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  There is indeed a significant Amman-based 
Iraqi business community that was active in trading with 
Iraq during the sanctions period.  Members of this 
community are not well known to the embassy, with which 
they avoided contact during the sanctions years.  Some of 
them may have been involved in activities that we could 
not condone.  Nonetheless, business people like the ones 
we met probably have financial capital, technical 
capacity, and knowledge of the situation on the ground in 
Iraq to which we would not otherwise have access, either 
inside or outside Iraq.  It could be useful to keep up a 
dialogue with them and see what they are actually able to 
deliver.  Following is bio information gleaned from 
participants in the meeting that may be useful to CPA and 
Washington agencies.

provide automobiles for the Iraqi market that was 
launched in 1988 before being abandoned.
