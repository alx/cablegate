SUBJECT:  HONDURAN ATMOSPHERICS - IRAQ 
 
¶1. Moderate Daily El Heraldo 3/22 - Article on a forum for 
students on the conflict in Iraq sponsored by the youth of 
the Democratic Unification Party (a leftist party made up of 
the remnants of the Socialists and Communist parties of the 
1980s).  Among the speakers was Carlos Reyes of the Bloque 
Popular (an NGO representing labor unions and other group 
opposed to globalization) and UD party members.  "The 
invasion of Iraq is part of a global [U.S.] strategy of 
gaining economic, political and military hegemony over the 
world.  Economically, the main project is FTAA, through 
which the U.S. seeks to challenge the EU and Japan; 
politically, the plan is to get rid of independent regimes 
and opposition movements; and the military is the means that 
will be used to achieve the other goals."  According to the 
president of the UD, this is "a war without humanitarian 
ends, one that "strengthens imperialism."  He also called 
the U.S. "the number one enemy of the people of the world." 
 
Note:  The Bloque Popular organized a small demonstration 
yesterday (250 people) in front of the U.S., Spanish and 
British Embassies and UN Headquarters to protest the war. 
 
¶2. "El Heraldo" 3/22 - Honduran Secretary of State Guillermo

backwards in the priority list of the United States.  George 
Bush's promise that this would be `the century of the 
Americas' has been put on hold since September 11.. The war 
will create problems in the already fragile relationhip 
between Latin-American countries, especially those that 
opposed the war, and the United States."
