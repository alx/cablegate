REF: STATE 74254 
 
¶1.  In the absence of the Director General for Multilateral 
Affairs, PolOff discussed reftel points with his assistant, 
Sylvia Corado on March 21.  Corado said the MFA had 
anticipated our position on this issue and agreed that the UN 
Charter gives responsibility for international peace and 
security to the UNSC.  She was noncommittal, however, to our 
points that other UN bodies such as the General Assembly or 
Commission on Human Rights would be inappropriate fora for 
discussions on Iraq.  Corado said the Foreign Minister and 
his Vice Ministers were consulting on our points, but 
discussions were going slower than she would like due to the 
Foreign Minister's travels.  Corado added that input from the 
Guatemalan PermRep in New York would probably be decisive. 
Corado could not comment on whether Guatemala would try to 
influence the NAM to prevent efforts to introduce the Iraq 
issue, but said she did not think the US had much to worry 
about from the NAM. 
 
¶2.  FonMin Gutierrez has just returned from abroad and 
Ambassador will endeavor to reach him.
