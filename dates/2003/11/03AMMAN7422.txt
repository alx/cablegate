RESOLUTION 
 
REF: STATE 317277 
 
PolCouns November 16 covered ref points on Canada's draft 
Iran human rights resolution in the UNGA Third Committee with 
Ali al-Ayed, Director of Foreign Minister Marwan Muasher's 
Private Office.  PolCouns emphasized the deterioration of 
Iran's human rights record over the past year, including the 
arrest of demonstrators, journalists, and pollsters, the 
beating death of a Canadian journalist while in custody, and 
continued discrimination against minorities.  He asked that 
Jordan support the resolution.  Ayed noted that Jordan 
usually votes with the Arab bloc on Iran resolutions, but 
promised to have the resolution reviewed to see whether 
Jordan could support it or abstain.
