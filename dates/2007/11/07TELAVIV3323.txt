Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
Major media reported that on Tuesday President Bush formally invited 
Israel and the PA to attend the Annapolis meeting.  Ha'aretz 
reported that PM Ehud Olmert's foreign policy adviser, Shalom 
Turgeman, agreed with U.S. officials that the content of the 
invitation would not be made public at this stage.  Major media 
reported that Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Syria, are 
among 40 bodies that received similar invitations.  Leading media 
repotted that on Tuesday the Israeli and the Palestinian negotiating 
teams met again in a last-ditch effort to prepare a joint document. 
The Jerusalem Post and other major media reported that during his 
visit to Sharm el-Sheikh Olmert won critical Egyptian support for 
Annapolis. 
 
Leading media reported that as a gesture to PA Chairman [President] 
Mahmoud Abbas, PM Olmert has approved the handover of 50 
Russian-made armored personnel carriers to the PA in Nablus.  The 
Israeli defense establishment had initially opposed the move.  The 
Palestinians will also receive 1,000 rifles with 2 million bullets. 
Maariv bannered: "[Israel] Again Giving Armored Vehicles to 
Palestinians." 
 
Ha'aretz reported that on Tuesday PM Olmert and Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak devoted considerable time to the issue of combating 
smuggling from Sinai into the Gaza Strip. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted senior GOI sources as saying that there is 
a growing sense in Jerusalem that Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton, the U.S. 
security coordinator with the Palestinians, is ineffective and 
should be replaced.  The sources were quoted as saying that a 
minister brought up the issue at Monday's cabinet meeting, saying: 
"I don't know what Dayton does.  I'm not sure what he does."  The 
Jerusalem Post quoted GOI sources as saying that there was a sense 
in Jerusalem that a more "dominant figure" was need in this 
position. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that earlier this week the state 
provided the High Court of Justice with statistics showing that 
sanctions on the Gaza Strip will not cause a humanitarian crisis. 
 
Leading media reported that ahead of Annapolis, One Jerusalem, a 
right-wing organization led by former cabinet minister Natan 
Sharansky, has launched a campaign against concessions involving 
Jerusalem.  At a press conference on Tuesday the group presented the 
results of a public opinion poll, according to which 76.5% of 
Israelis oppose handing over the Old City, the Temple Mount, and the 
city's Arab neighborhoods as part of a peace agreement. 
 
Yediot reported that on Monday US Under Secretary of Agriculture, 
Mark Keenum, asked Israel's Agriculture Minister Shalom Simhon to 
stop importing pistachio nuts (4,000 tons a year) from Iran -- via 
Turkey. 
 
Major media quoted IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi as saying on 
Tuesday that he does not expect another Intifada should Annapolis 
fail.  However, the media quoted him as saying that terrorist 
attacks are expected.  Maariv reported that the heads of Israel's 
three intelligence agencies -- Mossad, Shin Bet, and IDF 
Intelligence -- are expected to expound to the security cabinet the 
expected repercussions of Annapolis.  (Israel Radio reported that 
the cabinet will also discuss a comprehensive report containing 
recommendations for Israel's national security concept, drafted 
around a year and a half ago by former cabinet minister Dan Meridor 
-- the brother of Sallai Meridor, Israel's Ambassador to the U.S. 
--, and never before discussed by the government)  Maariv cited the 
belief of the defense establishment that an agreement with Abbas 
cannot be implemented as long as Hamas controls Gaza, but that if 
Israel does not attend the meeting, Hamas might take over the West 
Bank. 
 
Media reported that Israel and the PA have resumed cooperation on 
the issues of limited exports of Palestinian agricultural produce 
and cellular phone frequencies.  Ha'aretz and other media reported 
that Israel has offered the PA assistance in establishing a social 
security system.  (The Jerusalem Post reported that Welfare and 
Social Services Minister Yitzhak Herzog has called on Quartet envoy 
Tony Blair to encourage cooperation between Israel and the PA in the 
areas of welfare and social services.) 
 
Maariv reported that the Shin Bet requires  settler youth who wish 
to become recruits, to inform on their friends. 
 
Ha'aretz ran features on the conflicting attitudes of two key 
European societies towards Israel: The daily's headline reads: 
"France is Falling in Love with Israel; in Britain They're Debating 
Whether It Has a Future." 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that on Tuesday Archbishop Antonio 
Franco, the Vatican Ambassador to the Holy Hand, expressed 
frustration over the decade-old failure to reach agreement with 
Israel on tax exemptions, among mounting criticism among senior 
Vatican officials on the state of relations between Israel and the 
Holy See. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Ambassador Richard Jones held a 
party for Yoram Ben Ze'ev, ambassador-designate to Germany.  Prior 
to this appointment, Ben Ze'ev was the deputy director-general of 
the Foreign Ministry, heading the North American desk. 
 
Makor Rishon-Hatzofe reported that in the first nine months of 2007, 
Israeli industry exported USD 162 million worth of goods to Jordan. 
This emerges from data by the Manufacturers Association of Israel, 
and is 59 percent higher than in the same period of 2006. 
 
All media reported that on Tuesday the shekel rose to its highest in 
nine years against the US dollar (3.898 shekels to a dollar).  The 
Jerusalem Post reported that the Israel Export Institute warned that 
the weakness of the US currency was causing losses of billions of 
shekels to exporters, while threatening to significantly damage the 
competitiveness of the local export industry.

Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar'el wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz: "Israel ... may return from the 
conference with things it had not ordered, such as conditions for 
moving forward on the real process, the one with the Palestinians." 
 
Ha'aretz editorialized: "Barak's actions are highly suspect: Is he 
willing to leave no stone unturned for peace only when he is prime 
minister?" 
 
Washington correspondent Shmuel Rosner wrote in Ha'aretz: "On the 
eve of [Annapolis], it is ... worth identifying the new chance of 
success it offers, whose main component is the victory of the 
battered and yellowing Roadmap." 
 
Columnist Calev Ben-David wrote in the conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post: "Riyadh shouldn't delude itself that 'normalization 
of relations' with the nation that is still the ground-zero of 
Islamic fundamentalism hasn't quite the currency it would like to 
believe it does." 
 
The ultra-Orthodox Hamodi'a editorialized: "If this conference does 
not end in failure -- that is to say: without a crisis ---, this 
will be considered an achievement." 
 
Chief Economic Editor Sever Plotker opined in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot: "The uncompromising Israeli demand 
towards the current Palestinian leadership, as recently expressed by 
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, should be: 'Define your future 
Palestinian state as the homeland of the Palestinians.'"

¶I.  "Being There" 
 
Senior Middle East affairs analyst Zvi Bar'el wrote in the 
independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz (11/21): "It now turns out that 
even an invitation to a conference that is only a get-together -- a 
ceremony of declarations -- has become a bargaining chip for Arab 
states that have so far been unable to resolve a single conflict. 
Not only are they bridesmaids, they are active actors in the 
negotiations.  As a result, the United States and Israel are holding 
two sets of negotiations: one with Abbas, the real guest of honor, 
and the other with the Arab leaders, in an effort to convince them 
to show up and support the talks with Abbas.  As such, the Arab 
leaders are given the legitimacy to present their own preconditions 
for actually holding a meeting.... As such, Israel, which lowered 
expectations for the summit to a ceremony for mid-term report cards, 
may return from the conference with things it had not ordered, such 
as conditions for moving forward on the real process, the one with 
the Palestinians." 
 
II. "Barak - Suspected Saboteur" 
 
Ha'aretz editorialized (11/21): "Barak's speech last Sunday at a 
party meeting strengthened the impression that Barak does not 
believe in the chances of success [of Annapolis].  Barak threw 
Annapolis only a few casual sentences.  Additionally, according to a 
leak from Monday's cabinet meeting, he spoke in favor of the 
settlers -- including those living in illegal outposts.  The Defense 
Minister has the right not to believe the summit will succeed, but 
he is absolutely forbidden from sabotaging it while working for a 
government that has decided to strive toward its success.... Barak's 
actions are highly suspect: Is he willing to leave no stone unturned 
for peace only when he is prime minister?  Is he unwilling to assist 
the drive toward a peace agreement -- and possibly even hamper it -- 
simply because he is not at the helm?" 
 
III.  "The Victory of the Roadmap" 
 
Washington correspondent Shmuel Rosner wrote in Ha'aretz (11/21): 
"Annapolis was born of the frustration that is an integral part of 
the road map: In the absence of implementation, the peace process 
will remain stuck in the first stage.... Annapolis was thought up as 
a subversive attempt to bypass this wearisome track.  But at the end 
of the bypass, the drivers find themselves holding the same map, 
traveling forward along the same road.  It is possible to call this 
a failure: The pretension that was at the heart of Rice's initiative 
has been discovered to be baseless.... It is certainly possible to 
term the Annapolis summit an unnecessary failure.  Nevertheless, on 
the eve of its occurrence, it is also worth identifying the new 
chance of success it offers, whose main component is the victory of 
the battered and yellowing Roadmap.  This is a victory of healthy 
logic over the shortsightedness of those who wish to cut corners, 
the knights of the bypass, who put on airs and then fly off. 
Annapolis will be a festive ceremony in honor of our having landed 
on the ground of reality." 
 
IV.  "Rocky Road from Mecca to Annapolis" 
 
Columnist Calev Ben-David wrote in the conservative, independent 
Jerusalem Post (11/21): "It is easy to understand what motivated the 
Saudis [when they made their peace initiative public] to take a more 
active role in the peace process.... This was shortly after 9/11, 
when Riyadh's public image in the West was at an all-time low.... 
These days, it is the growing threat of Iranian influence that is 
motivating Abdullah in his recent charm offensive.  The Saudis want 
to be as much in the drivers' seat as possible when it comes to 
policy re Teheran; they fervently want to contain Iran, while at the 
same time desperately want to prevent any outright confrontation 
with it, either involving themselves or anyone else.... Israel, of 
course, would and should welcome any Saudi participation in 
Annapolis as a step in the right direction.  But Riyadh shouldn't 
delude itself that 'normalization of relations' with the nation that 
is still the ground-zero of Islamic fundamentalism hasn't quite the 
currency it would like to believe it does." 
 
¶V.  "A Conference with Foretold Results" 
 
The ultra-Orthodox Hamodi'a editorialized (11/21): "Not one side -- 
the United States, the host country, nor the 40 guest countries, are 
convinced that there will be positive or practical results at 
Annapolis.  If this conference does not end in failure -- that is to 
say: without a crisis ---, this will be considered an achievement. 
Some will say: 'The importance of the conference lies in its very 
convening.  The true meaning of that utterance is: Nothing real is 
supposed to -- or will -- come out of it." 
 
VI.  "Jews to Israel, Palestinians to Palestine" 
 
Chief Economic Editor Sever Plotker opined in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (11/21): "Back in 1947, the [United 
Nations'] General Assembly already decided that it would be 
preferable to maintain a Jewish character, as far as possible, for 
the Jewish state, and an Arab character for the Arab state.... 
Clinton hoped until the last day of his presidency that Arafat would 
accept his plan.  This was a false hope; Arafat did not dream of 
agreeing to a situation where the new Palestinian state would be 
defined as the only national home for all the Palestinians.  He 
understood that if Palestine would be considered by the world as the 
'state of the Palestinians,' this would nullify their demand to 
'return' to the state of the Jews, which is Israel.  If each people 
returns to its own country, there is no right of return.  The 
uncompromising Israeli demand of the current Palestinian leadership, 
as recently expressed by Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, should be: 
'Define your future Palestinian state as the homeland of the 
Palestinians.'  Only this way will the basic idea of the UN 
resolution from November 29, 1947 be fulfilled: a Palestinian state 
for the Palestinians, a Jewish state for the Jews.  One nation state 
for each nationality, and the two will live at peace with one 
another."
