SUBJECT: LIBYA: SECTION 565 WAIVER OF PROHIBITION AGAINST CONTRACTING 
WITH FIRMS COMPLYING WITH AL BOYCOTT 
 
REF: A) STATE 166398, B) 06 TRIPOLI 623, C) TRIPOLI 972 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Government of Libya (GOL) does not maintain 
diplomatic relations with Israel.  Local firms are required by 
national law to comply with the boycott, and would therefore not 
be able to sign the required U.S. certification without exposing 
themselves to civil and/or criminal penalties.  Post accordingly 
requests a waiver of of the Arab League boycott certification. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Post continues to raise the Arab League boycott issue 
in its meetings with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
Ministry of Economy and Trade.  Most recently, in the fall, the 
Charge' pressed the MFA's Secretary for the Americas on the 
issue, noting that AL boycott language in Libyan contracts would 
undermine GOL efforts to attract U.S. business.  The MFA 
official replied that the GOL and private entities are compelled 
by Libyan law stemming from the AL resolution to include 
language requiring compliance with the AL boycott 
 
¶3. (SBU ) The Ministry of Trade and Economy informed Post that 
the GOL does not enforce the boycott.  While this may be GOL 
policy, as a practical matter boycott language continues to 
appear in contract language, and is sometimes enforced, 
sometimes not.  As detailed ref C, for example, a U.S. company 
was presented with a draft contract by Libya's National 
Procurement Authority (NPA) containing language requiring the 
company to acknowledge that it observed a comprehensive boycott 
of Israel.  The language was expansive, barring any business 
contact with or investment in Israel, and requiring the U.S. 
company to abide by all laws and decisions related to the AL's 
boycott action.  Representatives of the U.S. company refused to 
sign the contract; the NPA subsequently removed the 
boycott-related language in its entirety.  To reinforce the 
decision and avoid potential misunderstanding, the parties 
agreed on and signed an English-only iteration of the contract. 
In an additional example, two German firms were reportedly asked 
to sign letters attesting that they were in compliance with the 
anti-Israel boycott as a pre-condition for securing required GOL 
stamps on export documents from the Libyan People's Bureau in 
Berlin (Libyan Embassy-equivalent).
