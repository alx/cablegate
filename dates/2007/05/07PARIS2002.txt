REF: STATE 68162 
 
We conveyed on May 18 relevant portions of reftel to MFA IO 
and AF contacts, stressing the importance of reaching 
agreement on UNOCI's future by June 1.  We had discussed 
informally the issue of Congressional notification earlier 
with several of our contacts, who were aware of USG 
notification requirements, having dealt with that issue on 
previous occasions concerning Cote d'Ivoire.  We expect to 
discuss UNOCI's mandate renewal with MFA counterparts in 
detail the week of May 21.
