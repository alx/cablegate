SUBJECT: DUTCH SERIOUS ABOUT UNSCR 1747 IMPLEMENTATION

REF: 
¶A. STATE 40909
¶B. STATE 40440
¶C. STATE 37801
¶D. THE HAGUE 566

Classified By: Economic Counselor Karen Enstrom,
reasons 1.4 (b) and (d)

¶1. (C) Econoff shared on April 2 ref A nonpaper on the U.S.
designation of Iran's Defense Industries Organization with
Anne-Chris Visser, Senior Policy Advisor, Financial Integrity
Division, Dutch Finance Ministry and Dutch Foreign Affairs
officials Huib Mijnerands, Senior Policy Advisor responsible
for sanction issues, and Joost van Ettro, Policy Advisor,
both in the Terrorism and New Threats Unit, Political Affairs
Department. On March 27, EconCouns discussed ref C points
with Mijnerands, who said the GONL had welcomed the adoption
of UNSCR 1747 as a clear signal of the international
community's willingness to take serious actions regarding
Iran. He was confident that EU implementation of UNSCR 1747
(and the formation of a common EU position and relevant
implementing regulations) would move forward quickly given
the work that had already been done on UNSCR 1737.

¶2. (S) In response to ref B, Dutch banks ING and ABN Amro
emphasized in separate meetings on March 8 with Treasury
Under Secretary Stuart Levey the limited nature of their
business with Iran. Rijkman Groenink, Chairman of the
Managing Board, told U/S Levey that ABN Amro was ceasing all
business with Iran and would not process U-turn transactions
for any Iranian bank. According to Carin Gorter, Senior Vice
President for Compliance and Legal, ABN Amro had closed all
but 16 Iran-related accounts, and these would be closed
within a few months.

¶3. (C) ING's Deputy Chief Risk Officer, Koos Timmermans,
told U/S Levey ING had blocked all accounts with Bank Sepah,
and that ING had less than a basis point of business in
Iran, no retail business, and no branch office in the
country. The remaining business was based on contractual
obligations with customers having global export operations.
He said ING was not actively seeking Iran business and its
compliance department was carefully monitoring the risks of
such business, including reputational risk.

¶4. (U) See ref D for additional reporting on U/S/ Levey's
meetings with GONL and ABN Amro and ING representatives.
