¶1. (SBU) Summary: Iceland's Foreign Minister signed the 
bilateral "Technical Agreement" on the closure of Naval Air 
Station Keflavik (NASKEF), as well as an agreement amending 
the classified annexes to the 1951 U.S.-Iceland defense 
agreement, at 1236 GMT on 29 September.  The last U.S. 
military personnel assigned to NASKEF are scheduled to depart 
Iceland at 1730 GMT on 30 September, seen off by the U.S. 
Ambassador and Embassy staff, Icelandic officials, 
NATO-member ambassadors, and local media. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Following on the 26 September announcement by PM 
Haarde  of the conclusion of defense negotiations with the 
U.S. (reftel), Foreign Minister Valgerdur Sverrisdottir on 29 
September signed the "Technical Agreement" covering the 
withdrawal of U.S. forces and the return of agreed areas to 
the GOI.  (DoD U/S Edelman had earlier signed the documents 
in Washington.)  The Minister also signed a document amending 
certain provisions of the 1951 U.S.-Iceland defense agreement 
as well as its annexes and technical schedules, some of which 
were classified per the GOI's 1951 request. (On 26 September 
post received a diplomatic note from the MFA requesting that 
all defense agreements between the U.S. and Iceland be 
declassified; we have forwarded to EUR/NB for action.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Later on September 29, NASKEF Commanding Officer 
Captain Mark Laughton and MFA officials completed the 
exchange of documents related to the handover or lease of 
USG-owned NASKEF equipment essential to continued operations 
at Keflavik Airport.  On the evening of 29 September, Navy 
Security will hand over responsibility for the base to the 
Keflavik District Police, who will protect its facilities 
while a new public corporation (reftel) considers a growing 
number of proposals for their use. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Captain Laughton and the remaining U.S. military 
personnel assigned to Naval Air Station Keflavik are 
scheduled to depart Iceland by Navy C-9 at 1730 GMT on 30 
September, seen off by the U.S. Ambassador and Embassy staff, 
Icelandic officials, NATO-member ambassadors, and local 
media.
