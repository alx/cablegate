SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S NEW AVIATION REGULATOR ASKS FOR INVITE TO 
WASHINGTON 
 
 
¶1. (U) This is an action cable. Please see paragraph 2 and 5 for 
details. 
 
¶2. (U) During an April 7 lunch with Emboffs, Directors Denise Abreu 
and Leur Lomanto of the newly created National Civil Aviation Agency 
(ANAC) asked that the FAA extend a formal invitation to ANAC 
representatives for May consultations in Washington and Miami. The 
purpose of their trip would to be to introduce themselves, to 
explain how ANAC will work and to explore areas of mutual 
cooperation. While they had planned on an April trip to the US, the 
deepening VARIG crisis necessitated a delay (septel). 
 
¶3. (SBU) The regulators explained that a formal invitation would 
help them to justify GOB funding of their trip to their superiors. 
This would be their first formal trip to see foreign aviation 
regulation authorities since taking office in March 2006. 
 
¶4. (U) ANAC was formally inaugurated in a March 20 ceremony in 
Brasilia and replaces the Department of Civil Aviation (DAC), 
subsuming all responsibilities for regulations, authorizations and 
registrations. ANAC will also take over the duties of certifying 
aircraft, currently performed by the Aerospace Technical Center 
(CTA) in the Air Force Command. The agency will be headquartered in 
Brasilia.  DAC will heretofore focus on policy and air-traffic 
control. 
 
¶5. (U) ACTION REQUESTED: Post recommends that FAA respond to this 
request positively.  We have a real opportunity to forge strong ties 
with Brazil's nascent aviation regulator.
