(A) AND (D) . 

¶2. (C) DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER MIGLIORE CALLED IN CHARGE 
CONFIDENTIAL 

PAGE 02 VATICA 01261 061419Z 
TO PRESENT A PRO MEMORIA ON THE SITUATION IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO (FAXED TO EUR/WE 3/6). (NOTE: FOREIGN 
MINISTER TAURAN IS ATTENDING THE POPE'S ANNUAL LENTEN 
RETREAT). 

¶3. (C) MIGLIORE EXPANDED UPON THE TEXT OF THE PRO 
MEMORIA. HE SAID THAT THE VATICAN IS REQUESTING THE U.S. 
AND THE UK TO PUT PRESSURE ON UGANDA AND RWANDA TO FULLY 
WITHDRAW ITS TROOPS FROM THE KIVU REGION, TO IMMEDIATELY 
CEASE THE ILLEGAL EXPLOITATION OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES, 
AND TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERCONGOLESE DIALOG. 
MIGLIORE SAID THAT THE UGANDAN/RWANDAN OCCUPATION OF KIVU 
CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATH OF OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE 
PAST FEW YEARS. 

¶4. (C) CHARGE INQUIRED IF THE HOLY SEE WOULD BE 
APPROACHING OTHER COUNTRIES IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. AND THE 
UK. MIGLIORE SAID THAT THE VATICAN HAD DECIDED TO LIMIT 
ITS DEMARCHE TO THE U.S. AND THE UK ON THE SITUATION IN THE 
KIVU REGION BECAUSE IT BELIEVES WE ARE THE TWO COUNTRIES 
WITH THE MOST INFLUENCE WITH THE RWANDANS AND THE UGANDANS. 
HOWEVER, THE VATICAN WILL BE CONTACTING THE ANGOLANS AND 
THE ZIMBABWEANS TO URGE THEM TO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE 
DIALOG. MIGLIORE SAID THAT HE BELIEVES ZIMBABWE IS GOING 
TO RESIST AS PRESIDENT MUGBAE'S SON IS A KEY PLAYER IN THE 
EXPLOITATION OF THE DIAMOND MINES IN THE DROC. MIGLIORE 
ALSO SAID THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING CONSULTING WITH THE 
BELGIAN AMBASSADOR. 

¶5. (C) COMMENT: THE FACT THAT MIGLIORE MADE NO MENTION OF 
CONSULTATIONS WITH THE FRENCH IS SURPRISING. THE FRENCH 
CONFIDENTIAL
