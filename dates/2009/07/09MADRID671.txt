¶1. (C) SUMMARY AND COMMENT. In a clear signal that Spain 
wants to work closely with the Obama Administration on a 
range of security issues, President Jose Luis Rodriguez 
Zapatero and several of his key cabinet ministers held 
extended meetings in Madrid on July 1 with DHS Secretary 
Janet Napolitano and members of her delegation.  The 
Secretary's meetings highlighted the importance that the USG 
places on the bilateral relationship and the numerous 
programs that DHS is working on with our Spanish hosts.  The 
Secretary also urged Spain to use its upcoming EU Presidency 
to resolve issues of data privacy and information sharing 
between the U.S. and the EU.  The interaction also served to 
establish close personal ties with senior members of the 
Zapatero Administration.  The meeting with Zapatero marked 
the longest time that Zapatero - in office since 2004 -  has 
spent in private discussions with senior USG officials. 
Zapatero, who spent 90 minutes with the Secretary in a 
meeting that was scheduled to last an hour, expounded on his 
views, with characteristic optimism, across a range of global 
issues and regional hotspots.  END SUMMARY AND COMMENT.
