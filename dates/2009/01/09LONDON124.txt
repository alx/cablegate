STATEMENTS OF CASE 
 
REF: A. STATE 3354      B. PARIS 57  

Classified By: Political Counselor Richard Mills, reasons 1.4 (b/d).  

(C) The UK prefers the previous approach and jointly prepared Statements of Case to put forward the individuals listed reftel A for sanctioning by the UNSC DRC Sanctions Committee, according to FCO Sanctions Team's Dominic Otway.  The UK strongly prefers the Statements of Case jointly drafted last year because they are more legally robust and send strong political messages on the recruitment of child soldiers. Additionally, HMG questions how the Rwandans would feel about only acting on four of the 19 individuals and presenting enhanced Statements of Case that the GOR had not prepared, which essentially communicates to the Rwandans that that their "information is OK, but not good enough."  In addition, Otway said the UK would like to send a political message to the FDLR members resident in Europe that European governments would be taking action against them so they should cease their supportive activities based in Europe.  Otway said he would consult more with the UK Missions in New York and Brussels on the best way forward, but wanted to communicate the UK's hesitation with this approach and strong preference for the previous approach.
