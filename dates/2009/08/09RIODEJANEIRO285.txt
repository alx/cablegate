SUBJECT: Rio Radar - August 21, 2009 
 
¶1. (U) Rio Radar is a weekly compilation of key economic, political, 
commercial, and other developments in the states of Rio de Janeiro, 
Bahia, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, and Sergipe.  This week's 
subjects: 
 
CLEANING UP THE FAVELAS: ECONOMIC BENEFIT TRUMPS COSTS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶2. (U) Since May 2009, the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro have 
systematically established a presence in five of the most violent 
favelas (shanty towns) within the Rio municipality.  Encouraged by 
successful results thus far, the Rio de Janeiro State Government is 
considering occupying and maintaining a police presence in all 1,000 
favelas within the city limits.  According to data provided by the 
Secretary of Security, these operations would cost the state between 
90 million to 340 million BR (48 million to 183 million USD).  Yet 
such activities could increase the city's Gross Domestic Product by 
30 percent to 38 billion BR (21 billion USD) through increased 
commerce and new jobs, according to analysts such as Jose Luiz 
Alqueres, president of the Commercial Association of Rio and Light. 
 
MILITIA GROUPS MOVE TO THE NORTH OF RIO 
--------------------------------------- 
¶3. (U) Militia groups, i.e. vigilante anti-narcotrafficker forces 
often associated with local political leaders and involved in 
racketeering and piracy, are rapidly moving from the west to the 
north area of the city (Baixada Fluminense), according to a 
researcher from NGO Global Justice, Rafael Dias.  This migration is 
due to coordinated action between the Rio de Janeiro Governor, 
Sergio Cabral, and Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes, to undermine militias' 
business activities.  The plan consists of military police 
incursions into Rio de Janeiro's most visible favelas and tighter 
enforcement over public transportation, especially unlicensed 
mini-vans, which serve as a multi-million dollar source of revenue 
for militias. 
 
INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RIO PORT AREA, AND... 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Petrobras and the two Brazilian steel companies, Gerdau and 
CSN, signed an MOU on July 7 to increase investment in the port area 
of Baia de Sepetiba in Rio de Janeiro state.  The three companies 
expect to invest 3 billion USD in streamlining infrastructure 
projects.  Petrobras, Gerdau and CSN had previously been developing 
the area separately, but will now work together with the goal of 
facilitating off shore pre-salt exploration and other initiatives. 
 
...INCREASED FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. (U) According to the Rio de Janeiro Federation of Industry, 
investment in the state of Rio de Janeiro will increase by 126.3 
billion BR (68 billion USD), the majority of which will come from 
foreign investors.  The Federation estimates such investment would 
create 360,000 new jobs throughout the state, which already accounts 
for 13 percent of the Brazilian Gross Domestic Product.  Analysts at 
the Federation argue that its forecasted increased investment could 
bring Rio's share of the national economy up to 20 percent. 
 
LACK OF SKILLED LABOR FOR PRE-SALT OIL DEVELOPMENT 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶6. (U) According to the Mobilization Program of the National Oil and 
Gas Industry (PROMINP), an estimated 285,000 skilled laborers - from 
painters to civil engineers - are needed to construct and maintain 
facilities for exploration and production of pre-salt oil reserves 
over the next five years. According to the Ministry of Social 
Development, this lack of skilled labor is a result of the poor 
curriculum in Brazilian public schools.  Rio de Janeiro State is in 
the most need of skilled labor, with current estimates at 5,920 
workers for next year alone.  Petrobras and the Ministry of Mines 
and Energy are now offering free qualification courses in areas such 
as mechanics and engineering. 
 
RIO BIOFUELS CONFERENCE HAILS BRAZILIAN ENERGY MATRIX 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶7. (U) In an August 13 conference entitled "Environment Education 
and the Future of Biofuels in Brazil" speakers hailed Brazil's 
energy matrix as an "example to the world."  The CEO of Petrobras 
Biofuels pointed out that 80% of global energy consumption is 
produced from coal, petroleum and derivatives.  In Brazil, however, 
coal constitutes only 6.2 percent of the energy matrix, while 
renewable energy makes up 46 percent.  In response to criticism that 
biofuels consumption leads to deforestation due to increased sugar 
cane and soy crops, a representative from the National Petroleum 
Regulatory Agency (ANP) argued that Brazil uses less than 5 percent 
of its arable land to produce biofuels.  He further stated the 19.6 
billions of liters of ethanol consumed in Brazil in 2008 prevented 
37.6 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.
