Title- U.S.-Brazil: business on diplomacy 
 
Op-ed in business oriented Valor Econtmico (8-10) states: 
"....Brazil and U.S. keep old divergences, like the rustproof U.S. 
tariff against the Brazilian ethanol and differences on trade 
negotiations at the World Trade Organization.  Now, the 
U.S.-Colombia military deal, criticized in Brasilia, adds to the 
list.  But the political relations between the two governments are 
doing well, and Washington is even trying to take trade advantages 
of it.....Barack Obama's administration now promises advantages to 
Brazil if it opts to buy Boeing's airplanes [on the Brazilian Air 
Force bid to buy new fighter planes]...It is tempting, but the 
Americans may have arrived too late.  The incident with the 
Supertucanos [when the U.S. blocked Brazil from selling the planes 
to Venezuela] created a [level of] distrust where the U.S. could go 
back on its word if there is a change in the administration there, 
says a Brazilian minister.  Nonetheless, on the political front the 
effort at rapprochement from both sides is visible....."
