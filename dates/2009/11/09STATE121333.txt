SUBJECT: GUIDANCE: ADOPTION OF UNSC RESOLUTION RENEWING 
UNSCR 1846 AND 1851 
 
REF: STATE 117724 
 
¶1.  USUN is instructed to join consensus on the U.S. drafted 
UN Security Council Resolution renewing UNSC resolutions 1846 
and 1851 to be adopted on November 30 (para 2).  USUN should 
also seek out co-sponsors for the resolution.  USUN should 
refer any further substantive changes on the Resolution to 
the Department prior to joining consensus for adoption. 
 
¶2. Begin text: 
 
-- The Security Council, 
 
i.  Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the 
situation in Somalia, especially resolutions 1814 (2008), 
1816 (2008), 1838 (2008), 1844 (2008), 1846 (2008), and 1851 
(2008), 
 
ii.  Continuing to be gravely concerned by the ongoing threat 
that piracy and armed robbery at sea against vessels pose to 
the prompt, safe, and effective delivery of humanitarian aid 
to Somalia and the region, to international navigation and 
the safety of commercial maritime routes, and to other 
vulnerable ships, including fishing activities in conformity 
with international law and the extended range of the piracy 
threat into the western Indian Ocean, 
 
iii.  Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, political independence and unity of 
Somalia, including Somalia's rights with respect to offshore 
natural resources, including fisheries, in accordance with 
international law, 
 
iv.  Further reaffirming that international law, as reflected 
in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 
December 1982 ("The Convention"), sets out the legal 
framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at 
sea, as well as other ocean activities, 
 
v.  Again taking into account the crisis situation in 
Somalia, and the limited capacity of the Transitional Federal 
Government (TFG) to interdict, or upon interdiction to 
prosecute pirates or to patrol or secure the waters off the 
coast of Somalia, including the international sea lanes and 
Somalia's territorial waters, 
 
vi.  Noting the several requests from the TFG for 
international assistance to counter piracy off its coast, 
including the letters of 2 and 6 November 2009 from the 
Permanent Representative of Somalia to the United Nations 
expressing the appreciation of the TFG to the Security 
Council for its assistance, expressing the TFG's willingness 
to consider working with other States and regional 
organizations to combat piracy and armed robbery at sea off 
the coast of Somalia, and requesting that the provisions of 
resolutions 1846 (2008) and 1851 (2008) be renewed for an 
additional twelve months, 
 
vii.  Commending the efforts of the EU operation Atalanta 
which the European Union is committed to extending until 
December 2010, North Atlantic Treaty Organization operations 
Allied Protector and Ocean Shield, Combined Maritime Forces' 
Combined Task Force 151, and other States acting in a 
national capacity in cooperation with the TFG and each other, 
to suppress piracy and to protect vulnerable ships transiting 
through the waters off the coast of Somalia, 
 
viii.  Noting with concern that the continuing limited 
capacity and domestic legislation to facilitate the custody 
and prosecution of suspected pirates after their capture has 
hindered more robust international action against the pirates 
off the coast of Somalia, and in some cases has led to 
pirates being released without facing justice, regardless of 
whether there is sufficient evidence to support prosecution, 
and reiterating that, consistent with the provisions of the 
Convention concerning the repression of piracy, the 1988 
Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the 
Safety of Maritime Navigation ("SUA Convention") provides for 
parties to create criminal offences, establish jurisdiction, 
and accept delivery of persons responsible for or suspected 
of seizing or exercising control over a ship by force or 
threat thereof or any other form of intimidation, and 
stressing the need for states to criminalize piracy under 
their domestic law and to favorably consider the prosecution, 
in appropriate cases, of suspected pirates consistent with 
applicable international law, 
 
ix.  Commending the Republic of Kenya's efforts to prosecute 
suspected pirates in its national courts, and noting with 
appreciation the assistance being provided by the United 
Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and other 
international organizations and donors, in coordination with 
the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia 
("CGPCS"), to support Kenya, Somalia, and other States in the 
region, including Seychelles and Yemen, to take steps to 
prosecute or incarcerate in a third state after prosecution 
elsewhere captured pirates consistent with applicable 
international human rights law, 
 
x.  Noting the ongoing efforts within the CGPCS to explore 
possible additional mechanisms to effectively prosecute 
persons suspected of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the 
coast of Somalia, 
 
xi.  Further noting with appreciation the ongoing efforts by 
UNODC and UNDP to support efforts to enhance the capacity of 
the corrections system in Somalia, including regional 
authorities, to incarcerate convicted pirates consistent with 
applicable international human rights law, 
 
xii.  Welcoming the adoption of the Djibouti Code of Conduct 
concerning the Repression of Piracy and Armed Robbery against 
Ships in the Western Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden, and 
the establishment of the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO) Djibouti Code Trust Fund (Multi-donor trust fund - 
Japan initiated), as well as the International Trust Fund 
Supporting Initiatives of the CGPCS, and recognizing the 
efforts of signatory states to develop the appropriate 
regulatory and legislative frameworks to combat piracy, 
enhance their capacity to patrol the waters of the region, 
interdict suspect vessels, and prosecute suspected pirates, 
 
xiii.  Emphasizing that peace and stability within Somalia, 
the strengthening of State institutions, economic and social 
development and respect for human rights and rule of law are 
necessary to create conditions for a durable eradication of 
piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, and 
further emphasizing that Somalia's long-term security rests 
with the effective development by the TFG of the National 
Security Force and Somali Police Force, in the framework of 
the Djibouti Agreement and in line with a national security 
strategy, 
 
xiv.  Determining that the incidents of piracy and armed 
robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia exacerbate the 
situation in Somalia, which continues to constitute a threat 
to international peace and security in the region, 
 
xv.  Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United 
Nations, 
 
¶1.  Reiterates that it condemns and deplores all acts of 
piracy and armed robbery against vessels in the waters off 
the coast of Somalia; 
 
¶2.  Notes again its concern regarding the findings contained 
in the 20 November 2008 report of the Monitoring Group on 
Somalia (S/2008/769, page 55) that escalating ransom payments 
and the lack of enforcement of the arms embargo established 
by resolution 733 (1992) are fueling the growth of piracy off 
the coast of Somalia, and calls upon all States to fully 
cooperate with the Monitoring Group on Somalia; 
 
¶3.  Renews its call upon States and regional organizations 
that have the capacity to do so, to take part in the fight 
against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of 
Somalia, in particular, consistent with this resolution and 
international law, by deploying naval vessels, arms and 
military aircraft and through seizures and disposition of 
boats, vessels, arms and other related equipment used in the 
commission of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast 
of Somalia, or for which there are reasonable grounds for 
suspecting such use; 
 
¶4.  Commends the work of the CGPCS to facilitate coordination 
in order to deter acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off 
the coast of Somalia, in cooperation with the IMO, flag 
States, and the TFG, and urges States and international 
organizations to continue to support these efforts; 
 
¶5.  Acknowledges Somalia's rights with respect to offshore 
natural resources, including fisheries, in accordance with 
international law, and calls upon States and interested 
organizations, including the IMO, to provide technical 
assistance to Somalia, including regional authorities, and 
nearby coastal States upon their request to enhance their 
capacity to ensure coastal and maritime security, including 
combating piracy and armed robbery at sea off the Somali and 
nearby coastlines, and stresses the importance of 
coordination in this regard through the CGPCS; 
 
¶6.  Invites all States and regional organizations fighting 
piracy off the coast of Somalia to conclude special 
agreements or arrangements with countries willing to take 
custody of pirates in order to embark law enforcement 
officials ("shipriders") from the latter countries, in 
particular countries in the region, to facilitate the 
investigation and prosecution of persons detained as a result 
of operations conducted under this resolution for acts of 
piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, 
provided that the advance consent of the TFG is obtained for 
the exercise of third state jurisdiction by shipriders in 
Somali territorial waters and that such agreements or 
arrangements do not prejudice the effective implementation of 
the SUA Convention; 
 
¶7.  Encourages Member States to continue to cooperate with 
the TFG in the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea, 
notes the primary role of the TFG in the fight against piracy 
and armed robbery at sea, and decides that for a period of 
twelve months from the date of this resolution to renew the 
authorizations as set out in paragraph 10 of resolution 1846 
(2008) and paragraph 6 of resolution 1851 (2008) granted to 
States and regional organizations cooperating with the TFG in 
the fight against piracy and armed robbery at sea off the 
coast of Somalia, for which advance notification has been 
provided by the TFG to the Secretary-General; 
 
¶8.  Affirms that the authorizations renewed in this 
resolution apply only with respect to the situation in 
Somalia and shall not affect the rights or obligations or 
responsibilities of Member States under international law, 
including any rights or obligations under the Convention, 
with respect to any other situation, and underscores in 
particular that this resolution shall not be considered as 
establishing customary international law; and affirms further 
that such authorizations have been renewed only following the 
receipt of the 2 and 6 November letters conveying the consent 
of the TFG, 
 
¶9.  Affirms that the measures imposed by paragraph 5 of 
resolution 733 (1992) and further elaborated upon by 
paragraphs 1 and 2 of resolution 1425 (2002) do not apply to 
weapons and military equipment destined for the sole use of 
Member States and regional organizations undertaking measures 
in accordance with paragraph 7 above or to supplies of 
technical assistance to Somalia solely for the purposes set 
out in paragraph 5 above which have been exempted from those 
measures in accordance with the procedure set out in 
paragraphs 11 (b) and 12 of resolution 1772 (2007); 
 
¶10.  Requests that cooperating States take appropriate steps 
to ensure that the activities they undertake pursuant to the 
authorizations in paragraph 7 do not have the practical 
effect of denying or impairing the right of innocent passage 
to the ships of any third State; 
 
¶11.  Calls on Member States to assist Somalia, at the request 
of the TFG and with notification to the Secretary-General, to 
strengthen capacity in Somalia, including regional 
authorities, to bring to justice those who are using Somali 
territory to plan, facilitate, or undertake criminal acts of 
piracy and armed robbery at sea, and stresses that any 
measures undertaken pursuant to this paragraph shall be 
consistent with applicable international human rights law; 
 
¶12.  Calls upon all States, and in particular flag, port, and 
coastal States, States of the nationality of the victims and 
perpetrators of piracy and armed robbery, and other States 
with relevant jurisdiction under international law and 
national legislation, to cooperate in determining 
jurisdiction, and in the investigation and prosecution of 
persons responsible for acts of piracy and armed robbery off 
the coast of Somalia, consistent with applicable 
international law including international human rights law, 
to ensure that all pirates handed over to judicial 
authorities are subject to a judicial process, and to render 
assistance by, among other actions, providing disposition and 
logistics assistance with respect to persons under their 
jurisdiction and control, such as victims and witnesses and 
persons detained as a result of operations conducted under 
this resolution; 
 
¶13.  Commends in this context the decision by the CGPCS to 
establish an International Trust Fund to support its 
initiatives and encourages donors to contribute to it; 
 
¶14.  Urges States parties to the Convention and the SUA 
Convention to fully implement their relevant obligations 
under these Conventions and customary international law and 
cooperate with the UNODC, IMO, and other States and other 
international organizations to build judicial capacity for 
the successful prosecution of persons suspected of piracy and 
armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia; 
 
¶15.  Welcomes the revisions by the IMO to its recommendations 
and guidance on preventing and suppressing piracy and armed 
robbery against ships, and urges States, in collaboration 
with the shipping and insurance industries, and the IMO, to 
continue to develop and implement avoidance, evasion, and 
defensive best practices and advisories to take when under 
attack or when sailing in the waters off the coast of 
Somalia, and further urges States to make their citizens and 
vessels available for forensic investigation as appropriate 
at the first port of call immediately following an act or 
attempted act of piracy or armed robbery at sea or release 
from captivity; 
 
¶16.  Requests States and regional organizations cooperating 
with the TFG to inform the Security Council and the 
Secretary-General within nine months of the progress of 
actions undertaken in the exercise of the authorizations 
provided in paragraph 7 above and further requests all States 
contributing through the CGPCS to the fight against piracy 
off the coast of Somalia, including Somalia and other States 
in the region, to report by the same deadline on their 
efforts to establish jurisdiction and cooperation in the 
investigation and prosecution of piracy; 
 
¶17.  Requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security 
Council within 11 months of the adoption of this resolution 
on the implementation of this resolution and on the situation 
with respect to piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast 
of Somalia; 
 
¶18.  Requests the Secretary-General of the IMO to brief the 
Council on the basis of cases brought to his attention by the 
agreement of all affected coastal States, and duly taking 
into account the existing bilateral and regional cooperative 
arrangements, on the situation with respect to piracy and 
armed robbery; 
 
¶19.  Expresses its intention to review the situation and 
consider, as appropriate, renewing the authorizations 
provided in paragraph 7 above for additional periods upon the 
request of the TFG; 
 
¶20.  Decides to remain seized of the matter.
