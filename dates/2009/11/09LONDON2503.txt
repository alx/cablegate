(SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche to the appropriate U.K. Treasury (HMT) and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) interlocutors on November 5, 2009.  Our HMT colleagues, who have the lead on IMF issues within the U.K. government, confirmed that the U.K. will be abstaining from the November 6 vote on the basis of the concerns they outlined at the July IMF Board meeting. They were unable to confirm if the U.K. Executive Board Director would raise their concerns during Board discussion or in public statements afterwards.  If any statement is made, it is unlikely to be echoed by government representatives in the U.K. as their current press focus is the November 6-7, G20 Finance Ministers meeting in St. Andrew's, Scotland.
