transparency of Libya's budget.  Replies are keyed to reftel: 
 
-Is the central government expected to receive or is it already 
receiving U.S. foreign assistance funding using FY 09 funds? 
Answer: Yes. 
 
-Is the host country's budget publicly available? 
Answer: Libya's overall budget figures are available online and 
in print media, mainly in official news articles with quotes 
from government officials.  However, more precise budget 
details, such as expenditures by sector, are not readily 
available. 
 
-Are incomes and expenditures included in the publicly-available 
budget? 
Answer: The overall expenditures are included in the 
publicly-available budget information. 
 
-What is post's assessment of the extent to which the 
publicly-available budget accurately reflects actual government 
incomes and expenditures? 
 
-Answer: The publicly-available budget accurately reflects 
actual government incomes and expenditures to the best of our 
knowledge.  Transparency of government budgeting and spending 
remains an issue for the Libyan government, which is reputed to 
suffer from corruption and inefficiency.
