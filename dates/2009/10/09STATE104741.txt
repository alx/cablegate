SUBJECT: SECURITY COUNCIL CONSULTATIONS:  COTE D'IVOIRE 
 
REF: STATE 100175 
 
¶1. (U) The Security Council will hold consultations on Cote 
d'Ivoire on October 13.  The Presidential Statement issued on 
September 29 (reftel) expressed the Council's concern about 
delays in preparations for the November 29 Ivorian elections, 
and stated the Council's intention to review the situation 
before October 15.  USUN may draw on the points in paragraph 
2 below. 
 
¶2. (U)  Begin points: 
 
--We thank Ambassador Choi for his briefing today, and again 
wish to express our appreciation for the continued dedication 
and hard work of the men and women of UNOCI. 
 
--The United States shares the frustration of our colleagues 
and, no doubt, of the Ivorian people in the continued delays 
in preparations for the presidential and parliamentary 
elections. 
 
--We urge the parties to observe the timeline for the 
elections and to take the steps necessary to hold nationwide 
elections that will demonstrate Cote d'Ivoire's respect for 
democracy and commitment to the peace process. 
 
--It is critical that the elections be open, free, fair, and 
transparent.  They should mark the first step into the next 
phase of Cote d'Ivoire's history, one in which all Ivorians 
can participate in creating a free and prosperous society. 
 
--The United States notes, as we did in July, that the UN 
Mission in Liberia is drawing down and that its ability to 
supplement UNOCI's support for the elections will only be 
available until the end of February, at the latest.  Time is 
running out. 
 
--As we are all aware, along with delays in preparing for the 
elections, there have been delays in demobilization and 
creation of mixed brigades.  We would appreciate Ambassador 
Choi's comments on how this might affect security for the 
elections, and what alternatives are available.  As I have 
said, UNMIL's support is available only for a limited time, 
at a level that has already been factored into the mission's 
drawdown schedule. 
 
--We appreciate the invaluable contribution that Licorne 
makes to peace and security in Cote d'Ivoire, and hope that 
it will continue to support UNOCI as necessary. 
 
--The United States would also like to express its concern 
about the recent reporting by the Sanctions Committee's Group 
of Experts that, despite some success, there are continuing 
violations of the arms embargo and diamond ban.  Particularly 
when arms and diamonds are moving across borders, these 
violations pose a threat not only to Cote d'Ivoire but also 
to its neighbors. 
 
--Only a few weeks ago the Council made it clear that we are 
prepared to consider additional steps.  The United States 
underlines that our goal and that of all Cote d'Ivoire's 
friends is that the elections be held, and that they meet the 
standards and aspirations of the people.
