¶1. (SBU) P/E Chief delivered reftel demarche jointly with the 
French DCM  (at Embassy of France's request) to the Deputy 
Director of the Libyan MFA's International Organizations Office, 
Murat Humaima, on September 30.  Humaima responded that Libya 
was unequivocally against nuclear enrichment for military 
purposes and was supportive of nonproliferation goals.  The best 
evidence of that, he said, was Libya's unilateral decision in 
2003 to dismantle its Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) 
programs.  Humaima said that while he had not heard from the 
Iranian side on the issue, he expected the Iranians to reach out 
to convey an explanation of their activities.  After proper 
review, he said, Libya would be able to take proper action 
vis-a-vis the Iranians. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Humaima expressed Libya's strong position against the 
use of sanctions to address breaches of international 
obligations; rather, such situations must be resolved through 
discussion and diplomacy.  He said that the October 1 meeting of 
the P5+1 in Geneva to discuss the issue was the right approach. 
The GOL believes the matter belongs to the IAEA and should not 
be addressed within the UN Security Council context.  The GOL 
is, however, supportive of POTUS's initiatives on 
nonproliferation as articulated during the September 24 UNSC 
meeting. 
 
¶3. (SBU) UK DCM informed P/E Chief separately September 30 that 
he had delivered the same demarche the previous day.  While the 
GOL response was largely the same, his interlocutor had not 
mentioned the GOL position against sanctions.
