2009 (S/2009/248) on the United Nations operation in Cyprus, 
 
      Noting that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in 
view of the prevailing conditions on the island it is 
necessary to keep the United Nations Peacekeeping force in 
Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 15 June 2009, 
 
      Echoing the Secretary-General's firm belief that the 
responsibility for finding a solution lies first and foremost 
with the Cypriots themselves, stressing that there now exists 
a rare opportunity to make decisive progress, and reaffirming 
the primary role of the United Nations in assisting the 
parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and division of the 
island to a comprehensive and durable settlement, 
 
      Commending the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot 
leaders for the political leadership they have shown, and 
warmly welcoming the progress made so far in the fully 
fledged negotiations, and the leaders, joint statements, 
 
      Strongly urging the leaders to increase the momentum in 
the negotiations to ensure the full exploitation of this 
opportunity to reach a comprehensive settlement based on a 
bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as 
set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions, 
 
      Emphasizing the importance attached by the 
international community of all parties engaging 
      fully, flexibly and constructively in the negotiations, 
and looking forward to decisive 
      progress in those negotiations in the near future, 
 
      Welcoming the intention of the Secretary-General to 
keep the Council informed of further 
      development and progress, 
 
      Welcoming also the implementation of some of the 
confidence building measures announced by the leaders, and 
calling for a renewed effort to implement the remaining 
measures and for agreement on and implementation of further 
steps to build trust between the communities, 
 
      Reaffirming the importance of continued crossings of 
the Green Line by Cypriots, encouraging the opening by mutual 
agreement of other crossing points, noting the commitment in 
the leaders joint statements to pursue the opening of the

implementation of the commitment to a second phase of the 
restoration of the Ledra Street crossing, and urging in this 
context the leaders to make every effort to implement those 
measures, 
 
      Convinced of the many important benefits for all 
Cypriots that would flow from a comprehensive and durable 
Cyprus settlement, and encouraging both sides clearly to 
explain these benefits, as well as the need for increased 
flexibility and compromise in order to secure them, to both 
communities well in advance of any eventual referenda, 
 
      Highlighting the supportive role the international 
community will continue to play in helping the Greek Cypriot 
and Turkish Cypriot leaders to exploit fully the current 
opportunity, 
 
      Taking note of the assessment of the Secretary-General 
that the security situation on the 
      island and along the Green Line remains stable, 
welcoming the decrease in the overall number of incidents 
involving the two sides and urging all sides to avoid any 
action, including restrictions on UNFICYP's movements as 
noted in the Secretary-General,s report (S/2009/248), which 
could lead to an increase in tension, undermine the good 
progress achieved so far, or damage the goodwill on the 
island, 
 
      Recalling the Secretary-General's firm belief that the 
situation in the buffer zone would be improved if both sides 
accepted the 1989 aide memoire used by the United Nations,

activities, and  looking forward to the clearance of the 
remaining minefields,

important activities of the Committee on Missing Persons, 
echoing the Secretary-General,s call for every possible 
action to be taken to speed up the exhumation process, and 
trusting that this process will promote reconciliation 
between the communities, 
 
      Agreeing that active participation of civil society 
groups is essential to the political 
      process and can contribute to making any future 
settlement sustainable, welcoming all efforts to promote 
bicommunal contacts and events including, inter alia, on the 
part of all United Nations bodies on the island, and urging 
the two sides to promote the active engagement of civil 
society and the encouragement of cooperation between economic 
and commercial bodies and to remove all obstacles to such 
contacts, 
 
      Stressing the need for the Council to pursue a 
rigorous, strategic approach to peacekeeping deployments,

voluntary contributions to the funding of UNFICYP, and his 
request for further voluntary contributions from other 
countries and organizations,

status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000; 
 
      ¶9.    Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report 
on implementation of this                       resolution, 
including on contingency planning in relation to the 
settlement, by 1 December           2009 and to keep the 
Security Council updated on events as necessary; 
 
      ¶10.   Welcomes the efforts being undertaken by UNFICYP 
to implement the Secretary-General's            zero 
tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to 
ensure full compliance of its       personnel with the United 
Nations code of conduct, requests the Secretary-General to 
continue to take all necessary action in this regard and to 
keep the Security Council                 informed, and urges 
troop-contributing countries to take appropriate preventive 
action            including the conduct of predeployment 
awareness training, and to take disciplinary action 
and other action to ensure full accountability in cases of 
such conduct involving their        personnel;
