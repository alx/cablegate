Davidsdottir, Counsellor for Human Rights at the Icelandic Ministry 
for Foreign Affairs on 2 March (Note: No MFA officials were

participating again as an observer at Human Rights Council meetings 
in Geneva and expressed her government's hope that the U.S. would 
consider running for a seat on the council. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On the Durban Review Process, Davidsdottir noted the 
notification of USG withdrawal with some disappointment but said the 
U.S. concerns on the document were well-understood at the ministry.
