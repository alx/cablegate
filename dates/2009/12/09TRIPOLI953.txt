¶1. (SBU) Post received a diplomatic note from the General 
People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International 
Cooperation (GPCFLIC; MFA-equivalent) on December 2 informing 
the Embassy of Libya's intention to seek membership on the UN 
Human Rights Council for the 2010-2013 term.  Attached to the 
note requesting U.S. support for Libya's candidacy was a 
nine-page document outlining Libya's qualifications and 
milestones in codifying human rights.  The GPCFLIC highlighted 
the Great Green Charter for Human Rights in the Jamahiriya Era 
from 1988, Law 20 of 1991 regarding individual human rights, and 
Libya's accession to various international conventions on human 
rights.  Post has sent scanned originals of the Arabic-language 
documents, as well as post's informal translation of the same, 
to NEA/MAG by email. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Embassy translation of the diplomatic note is included 
below.

International Cooperation 
 
The General People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and 
International Cooperation (International Organizations 
Department), sends its compliments to the U.S. Embassy in the 
Great Jamahiriya, and has the honor to inform the esteemed 
Embassy that Libya decided to run for membership of the Human 
Rights Council for the period 2010-2013 during the elections due 
to be held at the UNGA in New York in May 2010. 
 
While the Great Jamahiriya appreciates the high importance of 
human rights on both international and national level for human 
rights that form the basis of all human and international 
relationships, it attaches herewith an explanatory note 
regarding its candidacy to this Council's membership. The note 
states its commitment to promote and protect human rights 
principles pursuant to the requirements of the UNGA`s resolution 
60/251. 
 
Great Jamahiriya hopes that your friendly country could support 
this candidature. 
 
The General People's Committee Secretariat for Foreign Liaison 
and International Cooperation (International Organizations' 
Dept) avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the esteemed 
US Embassy the assurances of its highest considerations.

¶3. (SBU) Comment and guidance request.  The diplomatic note was

resident in Tripoli received the same.  Post requests guidance 
on what, if any, response should be given.  End comment and 
guidance request.
