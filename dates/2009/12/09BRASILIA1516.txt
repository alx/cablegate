COP15 DESPITE DISAPPOINTING RESULTS

¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Government of Brazil (GOB) expressed 
disappointment and frustration with the Conference of the 
Parties-15 (COP-15) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen.  President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva 
principally blamed the position of the United States on mitigation, 
which he called "too little" and one that did not evolve during the 
conference.  The modest USG goal for 2020 led to Europe not 
increasing its mitigation proposal from 20 percent to 30 percent 
for 2020, he explained, and the USG's position incentivized Japan 
and others to try to eliminate the Kyoto Protocol.  Still, Brazil 
accepts the Copenhagen Accord and sees it as a step forward. 
Moreover, Lula crowed that Brazil had the best image at COP15 due 
to its ambitious proposal.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
 
DISAPPOINTMENT AND FRUSTRATION, MAINLY WITH USG 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Brazilian press has generally viewed the Conference 
of the Parties-15 (COP-15) to the UN Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen as a failure.  President Luiz 
Inacio Lula da Silva, however, has taken a slightly more moderated 
stance.  He has not called COP15 a failure nor a fiasco.  In fact, 
Lula commented that the final results were "better than expected" 
compared with the low expectations at the beginning of the 
conference.  Lula and the Brazilian delegation have expressed deep 
frustration on the lack of progress at COP15. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Lula has singled out the United States for particular 
criticism.  In his December 21 weekly radio address, Lula said the 
USG offered "very little" with respect to a 2020 mitigation goal. 
Earlier he told the press that he had wanted to see an improvement 
or evolution of the USG position at COP15, but that didn't happen. 
In his weekly address, he elaborated that the USG isn't a member of 
the Kyoto Protocol and that with some members of the Kyoto Protocol 
(Japan and others) they pressed for an end to the Kyoto Protocol. 
In an earlier interview, Lula linked the Europeans not raising 
their proposed reduction in emissions for 2020 from 20 percent to 
30 percent to the United States not making a better offer. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Key members of the Brazilian delegation echoed Lula's 
comments about the United States and expanded on the theme. 
Presidential Chief of Staff and presidential candidate Dilma 
Rousseff called the USG financing offer, together with others, of 
US$30 billion through 2012 "ridiculous compared to the needs of the 
developing world."  Environment Minister Carlos Minc said at the 
close of COP15 that Brazil was disappointed with the results.  He 
criticized President Obama, saying the people of the planet 
expected more of a Nobel prize winner.  Minc then urged Obama in 
the upcoming negotiations "to do something or return the Nobel 
prize."  However, a key scientific advisor on the Brazilian 
delegation, Professor Jose Goldemberg of the University of Sao 
Paulo, said that Secretary Clinton's participation at COP15 was 
strong and positive, though he added that President Obama probably 
could have been more effective if he had arrived earlier. 
 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) There was criticism for other countries besides the 
United States.  Minister Minc said there had been "bad faith" from 
various sides.  He criticized Cuba and Venezuela by name, saying 
that they and others had sought to block the COP15 from approving 
the Copenhagen Accord.  He added that "there were too many people 
staring at their navels, and also a climate of distrust that was 
very bad."  The Brazilian press points to China as impeding 
progress through its recalcitrance over allowing international 
verification. 
 
 
 
BRAZIL THE HERO 
 
BRASILIA 00001516  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Lula has portrayed Brazil as a white knight at COP15.  In 
his radio address, he stated that "Brazil was considered, during 
the entire summit, to be the country that presented the best 
proposal, as the country that worked on this issue correctly."  He 
highlighted Brazil's role in working with the United States, China, 
India and South Africa to reach an agreement.  Brazil's Ambassador 
for Climate Change Sergio Serra told the press that Brazil had 
helped mediate between President Obama and the Chinese to conclude 
the Copenhagen Accord. 
 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) While Lula reiterated the Brazilian offer to reduce its 
emissions by 36.1 to 38.9 percent by 2020 compared with "business 
as usual," post-COP15 he and his team have remained quiet about 
Brazil's willingness to contribute to a global climate change fund. 
On financing, however, Lula said that Brazil will implement its 
mitigation activities entirely through its own will.  Brazil is not 
conditioning its efforts on outside financing, though they clearly 
anticipate receiving significant sums from abroad.  Lula 
underscored in his radio address that the mitigation actions Brazil 
presented at COP15 have now been enacted as part of domestic 
legislation.  With this legislation in place, he explained, 
Brazil's ambitious position on climate change is no longer just 
"Lula's position," but the law, and the next president will have to 
comply with that law. 
 
 
 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE 
 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Despite disappointment and frustration with COP15, Lula 
said that he was optimistic about his relationship with Obama.  He 
declared, "I am an optimist.  I think that Obama may produce a 
pleasant surprise."  He added, "I expect at COP16 in Mexico that we 
will arrive at an agreement.  I think this is possible."  Lula 
stated, "Between now and COP16 in Mexico the world needs to do all 
it can to reach an agreement." 
 
 
 
COMMENT 
 
 
 
¶9.  (SBU) President Lula, his team, and the Brazilian press left 
Copenhagen frustrated and disappointed.  They attributed much of 
the lack of progress there to what they viewed as a modest proposal 
on mitigation by the United States that did not improve over the 
course of the conference.  Nonetheless, Brazil accepts the 
Copenhagen Accord and is proud that it was part of the small group 
that negotiated it.  Despite the grumbling, Brazil is neither 
disowning the Copenhagen Accord nor backing away from its ambitious 
proposals on mitigation.  END COMMENT.
