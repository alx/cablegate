The Security Council, 
 
Noting the letter from the Prime Minister of Iraq to the 
President of the Security Council, dated 14 December 2009, 
which is annexed to this resolution. 
 
Recognizing the positive developments in Iraq and that the 
situation now existing in Iraq is significantly different 
from that which existed at the time of the adoption of 
resolution 661 (1990), recognizing that Iraqi institutions 
are strengthening, and further recognizing the importance of 
Iraq achieving international standing equal to that which it 
held prior to the adoption of resolution 661 (1990), 
 
Recognizing that the letter from the Prime Minister of Iraq 
also reaffirms the commitment by the Government to resolve 
the debts and settle the claims inherited from the previous 
regime, and to continue to address those debts and claims 
until they are resolved or settled, and requests the 
continued assistance of the international community, as the 
Government of Iraq works to complete this process, 
 
Recognizing the significant role of the Development Fund for 
Iraq and the International Advisory and Monitoring Board, and 
the provisions of paragraph 22 of resolution 1483 (2003) in 
helping the Government of Iraq to ensure that Iraq,s 
resources are being used transparently and accountably for 
the benefit of the Iraqi people, and recognizing also the 
need for Iraq during 2010 to transition to successor 
arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq and the 
International Advisory and Monitoring Board, to include the 
Committee of Financial Experts (COFE), 
 
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 
 
¶1. Decides to provide an extension, until 31 December 2010, 
on the arrangements established in paragraph 20 of resolution 
1483 (2003) for the depositing into the Development Fund for 
Iraq of proceeds from export sales of petroleum, petroleum 
products and natural gas and the arrangements referred to in 
paragraph 12 of resolution 1483 (2003) and paragraph 24 of 
resolution 1546 (2004) for the monitoring of the Development 
Fund for Iraq by the International Advisory and Monitoring 
Board and further decides that, subject to the exception 
provided for in paragraph 27 of resolution 1546 (2004), the 
provisions of paragraph 22 of resolution 1483 (2003) shall 
continue to apply until that date, including with respect to 
funds and financial assets and economic resources described 
in paragraph 23 of that resolution; 
 
¶2. Decides further that the provisions in the above paragraph 
for the deposit of proceeds into the Development Fund for 
Iraq and for the role of the International Advisory and 
Monitoring Board and the provisions of paragraph 22 of 
resolution 1483 (2003) shall be reviewed at the request of 
the Government of Iraq or no later than 15 June 2010; 
 
¶3. Requests the Secretary-General to provide written reports 
to the Council on a quarterly basis, with the first report no 
later than 01 April 2010, to include details on progress made 
in strengthening financial and administrative oversight of 
the current Development Fund for Iraq, as well as the legal 
issues and options to be considered to implement successor 
arrangements and an assessment of the Government of Iraq,s 
progress in preparing for the successor arrangements for the 
Development Fund. 
 
¶4. Calls upon the Government of Iraq to put in place the 
necessary action plan and timeline by 01 April 2010 and to 
ensure the timely and effective transition to a 
post-Development Fund mechanism by 31 December 2010, which 
takes into account IMF Stand-By Arrangement requirements and 
includes external auditing arrangements and enables Iraq to 
meet its obligations as established in the provisions of 
paragraph 21 of resolution 1483. 
 
¶5. Requests the Government of Iraq through the head of the 
Council of Financial Experts (COFE) to report to the Security 
Council on a quarterly basis, with the first report no later 
than 01 April 2010 to provide an action plan and timeline for 
 the transition mechanism from the Development Fund and 
details on the progress made in strengthening financial and 
administrative oversight of the current Development Fund for 
Iraq, with subsequent quarterly reports to provide an 
assessment of progress against the action plan and oversight 
improvements.
