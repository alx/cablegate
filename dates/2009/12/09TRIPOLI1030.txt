SUBJECT: LIBYA: 2009 COUNTRY REPORTS ON TERRORISM 
 
REF: STATE 109980 
 
¶1. (U) The United States rescinded Libya's designation as a 
state sponsor of terrorism in June 2006.  Libya renounced 
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction in 2003 and has 
continued to cooperate with the United Sates and the 
international community to combat terrorism and terrorist 
financing. 
 
¶2. (U) On July 20, Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure 
confirmed to the Malian press that Libya, Algeria, and Mali 
planned to coordinate military and intelligence efforts to fight 
security threats linked to al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the Islamic 
Maghreb (AQIM) in the Sahel-Saharan region. 
 
¶3. (U) In November 2007, Egyptian cleric and al-Qa'ida (AQ) 
leader Ayman al-Zawahiri announced a merger between AQIM and the 
Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG).  In an audiotape, 
al-Zawahiri urged AQ fighters to topple the Government of Libya, 
describing Muammar al-Qadhafi as an "enemy of Islam" and 
criticizing the 2003 decision to renounce WMD and terrorism.  In 
late September, six leading members of the Libyan Islamic 
Fighting Group, being held in the Abu Salim prison, issued a 
document renouncing violence and claiming to adhere to a more 
sound Islamic theology than that of Al Qaeda and other jihadist 
organizations. The 417-page, Arabic-language document, entitled 
"Revisionist Studies of the Concepts of Jihad, Verification, and 
Judgment of People," was the product of a two-year 
reconciliation project between the Government of Libya and the 
LIFG, facilitated by the Qadhafi Development Foundation.  The 
authors state that "The lack of religious knowledge, whether it 
was a result of an absence of 'ulama' (religious scholars) or 
the neglect of people in receiving it and attaining it, or due 
to the absence of its sources, is the biggest cause of errors 
and religious violations." 
 
¶4. (U) In the text, the authors directly challenge al-Qa'ida, 
addressing the recantation to "anyone who we might have once had 
organizational or brotherly ties with."  The document gives 
detailed interpretations of the "ethics and morals to jihad," 
which include the rejection of violence as a means to change 
political situations in Muslim majority countries whose leader 
is a Muslim and condemns "the killing of women, children, the 
elderly, monks/priests, wage earners, messengers, merchants and 
the like."  It claims that "The reduction of jihad to fighting 
with the sword is an error and shortcoming."  According to press 
and government sources, at least 144 former LIFG members and 60 
members of other jihadist groups have been released from prison 
after completing this rehabilitation effort. 
 
¶5. (U) On March 23, a foreign embassy in Tripoli recommended 
that travelers avoid the cities of Ghadames and Ghat on the 
Libya-Algeria border.  The Ministry cited Libyan authorities 
speaking of "an increasing threat of terrorism" and "risk of 
abduction" due to "heightened political tensions in the Arabic 
or Islamic world." 
 
¶6. (U) On August 14, 2008 Libya and the United States signed a 
comprehensive claims settlement agreement to provide 
compensation to claimants in both countries who allege the other 
country's responsibility in incidents causing injury or death. 
Included in the settlement agreement are claims stemming from 
the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, 
and the 1986 bombing of the La Belle nightclub in Berlin.
