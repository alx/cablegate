¶1.  Poloff coordinated with Mission's Office of Defense 
Cooperation (ODC) regarding license 05-878248 for the export 
of technical data to Izar Construcciones Navales.  The ODC 
confirmed that MOD has approved a program to build a new S-80 
class of submarines and is competitively soliciting several 
companies to supply technical data.  The transfer of 
technical data to Izar Construcciones Navales appears 
legitimate.
