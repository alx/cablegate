SUBJECT: DAS DESHAZO'S MEETING WITH FM BARCO 
 
Classified By: Ambassador William B. Wood, Reasons: 1.5 B & D. 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  In a meeting on February 6, WHA DAS Peter 
DeShazo and FM Carolina Barco discussed paramilitary 
demobilization and the OAS resolution on its verification 
mission, Colombia-Venezuela relations, and President Uribe's 
February 8-14 visit to Europe.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) At the February 6 meeting in Bogota, WHA DAS Peter 
DeShazo was accompanied by DCM Milton Drucker, AID Director 
Michael Deal, and poloff Brian Walch.  FM Carolina Barco was 
joined by Vice Minister Camilo Reyes (her deputy) and North 
America Director Francisco Gonzalez. 
 
¶3.  (C) On the subject of paramilitary demobilization, 
DeShazo stressed the need for accountability and truth, as 
well as justice for victims.  Barco reiterated the GOC's 
commitment to keep extradition on the table, and worried 
about striking the correct balance between peace and justice. 
 Barco expressed concern over Venezuela's intransigence on 
the OAS vote in support of a verification mission for 
paramilitary demobilization.  (Note:  Later the same day, the 
OAS voted to support the verification mission.  End Note.) 
 
¶4.  (C) On relations with Venezuela, Barco noted that they 
have been rocky.  She stressed President Uribe's and her 
desire to limit "microphone diplomacy."  Despite friction, 
there have been two Uribe-Chavez summits during the Uribe 
Administration and continuing military dialogue at the field 
commander level.  Barco mentioned plans to have vice FM level 
meetings to manage border incursion incidents.  However, she 
lamented that defense minister meetings had not taken place. 
Turning to internal Venezuelan issues, DeShazo outlined U.S. 
policy and stressed the importance of the OAS and Carter 
Center in ensuring transparency in the all important 
signature verification process currently being conducted by 
the National Electoral Council.  Barco expressed complete 
agreement. 
 
¶5.  (C) Regarding President Uribe's February 8-14 visit to 
Europe, Barco stated that Uribe would carry the message that 
public security and human rights have both improved markedly 
during his administration.  Barco indicated Uribe would meet 
with ten prominent European human rights NGOs to explain his 
record.  Barco worried, however, that Uribe might receive a 
lukewarm reception at the European Parliament.
