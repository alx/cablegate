¶1.  Marcus Vinicius da Costa of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs (MFA) Division of Services, Investments and 
Financial Issues told Emboff August 13 that the GoB is 
considering signing the Capetown Convention on Aircraft 
Financing.  In response to lobbying by Brazilian aircraft 
manufacturer Embraer, which strongly favors GoB adherence to 
the treaty, the MFA formally has requested comments from the 
Ministry of Finance, Central Bank and other interested 
industry parties.  The GoB bureaucratic process is still at 
a preliminary stage, he said, and obtaining an opinion on 
the convention from the Ministry of Finance legal department 
would be the next key step.  Noting that U/S Larson had 
urged Finance Ministry Executive Secretary Appy and 
International Secretary Pereira to consider adhering to the 
convention during his July 21 visit (reftel), Emboff 
encouraged da Costa not to allow the GoB's deliberations to 
lose momentum.
