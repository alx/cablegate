SUBJECT: LIBYA/NPT: FOLLOW-UP TRILATERAL DEMARCHE DELIVERED REF: A) STATE 7931; B) TRIPOLI 46; C) STATE 5942; D) STATE 4457
CLASSIFIED BY: Gene A. Cretz, Ambassador, U.S. Embassy Tripoli, Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) (C)

The Ambassador, along with the UK and Russian Ambassadors, orally conveyed the text of the second demarche (reftel) regarding Libya's proposal to amend the NPT. The Libyan team, headed by MFA Under Secretary Abdelati Obedi listened carefully and thanked us for a comprehensive, and clear response to Libya's questions from the first round demarche. Obeidi wanted to know what guarantees the three depositary states could provide that the discussions of Libya's proposals would be part of the formal agenda, given that the agenda was "closed." Libya appreciated the three options we had provided as an alternative to circulating the amendment proposal but questioned how those options insured a full and formal discussion of Libya's ideas. Obeidi noted that any party could do what we were proposing, strongly hinting that he did not see how our response answered Libya's concerns and initiative. He reiterated Libyan appreciation for the response, and said he would take it to Libyan leader Qadhafi, who he claimed had initiated the proposal. The Libyan response was extremely brief after our presentation as it was clear Obeidi had a more pressing commitment. CRETZ
