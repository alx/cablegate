¶1. (U) This is an action request; please see para 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a January 25 meeting with Pol/Econ chief, a 
representative of the Qadhafi International Charity and 
Development Foundation (QDF) requested immediate assistance to 
obtain flight clearances for a Libyan Boeing 747 plane, carrying 
17 tons of relief supplies, to land at the Port-au-Prince 
airport.  The full list of supplies on the plane is included in 
para 3.  (Note: The QDF is managing Libya's assistance efforts 
in coordination with the Libyan government's Agency for 
Assistance and Relief. End note.)  The representative reported 
that the QDF had already facilitated the delivery of one plane 
carrying 1000 tents, hygienic supplies, sleeping bags, and 
medical equipment to Haiti via the Dominican Republic.  The QDF 
had been working with the Dominican Republic's Foreign Ministry 
but had not been able to ensure that the assistance was 
distributed in Haiti.  The QDF was told by the Dominican MFA 
that it must turn over all donations to the Red Cross in Santo 
Domingo for further distribution in Haiti.  The QDF was 
uncomfortable with this arrangement and requested official U.S. 
assistance to directly deliver the materials in Haiti.  The QDF 
reported having been told by a "chartering company" (NFI) that 
the earliest possible date the Libyan plane could land in 
Port-au-Prince was on February 12.  The QDF requested permission 
from poloff instead for the plane to land within the next 1-4 
days. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Pol/Econ chief thanked Libya for its contributions and 
delivered reftel demarche.  Per reftel, she underscored that the 
U.S. civilian agencies and the military are working with the 
Haitain government and the United Nations to assist in the 
delivery of humanitarian support on the ground, and assured him 
that she would pass on his concerns and requests for assistance 
to Washington and USUN.  The QDF representative noted his 
appreciation for the U.S. role in coordinating relief efforts 
and said that Libya would offer as much assistance as possible, 
in terms of medical personnel, supplies and equipment.  He 
requested an update on areas of need, suggesting that Libya 
could provide portable "Thuraya" telephone booths and a thousand 
more tents. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The full list of supplies contained on the Libyan plane 
bound for Haiti is as follows: 
 
-7000 first aid kits (total weight 2 tons); 
-1500 sleeping bags (total weight 1 ton); 
-3000 plastic mats (total weight 5 tons); 
-100 packages of "medicine and surgical equipment" (weighing 
five tons each); 
-1 power generator (total weight 4 tons). 
 
¶5. Post appreciates the Department's guidance for a response to 
the Libyan request for flight clearance for a Libyan Boeing 747 
to land in Port-au-Prince within the next 1-4 days.
