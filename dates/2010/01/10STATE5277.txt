MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF OF MISSION OR 
CHARGE D'AFFAIRES 
 
E.O. 12958: N/A

SUBJECT: Personally Engaging on Haiti 
 
¶1.   The tragic earthquake in Haiti and its aftermath 
pose enormous challenges to the people of Haiti, our 
nation, and the entire world community.  As we seek to 
rescue trapped victims, assist survivors, and help Haiti 
begin to rebuild, the American people and our government 
have marshaled unprecedented resources to help, 
reflecting the best of our nation's values. 
 
¶2.   I am deeply concerned by instances of inaccurate 
and unfavorable international media coverage of 
America's role and intentions in Haiti.  This 
misinformation threatens to undermine the international 
partnership needed to help the people of Haiti, and to 
damage our international engagement across the range of 
issues.  It is imperative to get the narrative right 
over the long term.  Where you see ill-informed or 
distorted perspectives in your host country media, I 
direct you as Chief of Mission to personally contact 
media organizations at the highest possible level ? 
owners, publishers, or others, as appropriate ? to push 
back and insist on informed and responsible coverage of 
our actions and intentions, and to underscore the U.S. 
partnership with the Government of Haiti, the United 
Nations, and the world community.  It is important that 
you and other members of your Embassy team engage 
opinion-makers in setting the record straight on 
America's commitment to assist the Haitian people and 
government in recovering from this disaster. 
 
¶3.   I also ask you to report back to me through your 
Assistant Secretary, citing specific examples of 
irresponsible journalism in your host countries, and 
what action you have taken in response.  This is a 
personal priority for me and I will be looking for your 
reports. 
 
¶4.  The Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy and Public 
Affairs, working with your regional Public Diplomacy 
Offices and your Public Affairs Officers at post, will 
ensure you have the latest facts and talking points. 
The Bureau of International Information Programs (IIP) 
has assembled a regularly updated Haiti Earthquake 
Assistance page to assist your efforts: 
https://infocentral.state.gov/haiti-earthquak e- 
assistance.  The Under Secretary will also coordinate a 
regular ALDAC cable conveying the latest facts and 
talking points. 
 
¶5.   Please let Under Secretary McHale and your regional 
Assistant Secretary know if you need additional 
information or other support to carry out this important 
engagement effort. 
 
¶6.    I thank you for your personal attention to this 
very important matter. 
 
¶7. Minimize considered.
