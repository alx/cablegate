SUBJECT: KOREA SEEKS U.S. VIEWS ON CIVIL NUCLEAR COOPERATION WITH LIBYA CLASSIFIED BY: Gene Cretz, Ambassador, U.S. Embassy Tripoli, U.S. Department of State. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d)

¶1. (SBU) This is an action request; please see para 4.

¶2. (C) The Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Libya, Dong Hee Chang recently told the Ambassador that his country was interested in advancing its civil nuclear cooperation with Libya and wanted to know if the U.S. had any objections. He said the South Korean Embassy in Washington had broached this topic with U.S. officials in Washington and had not received any reply. (It is unclear which USG agency or office was contacted.) Specifically, South Korea would like to provide nuclear reactors for power generation to Libya. South Korea's Ambassador told the Ambassador that any potential South Korean civil nuclear cooperation with Libya would be fully coordinated with the IAEA.

¶3. (C) Over the last year, Libya has stepped up its civil nuclear programs, signing agreements for similar cooperation with France, Argentina, Canada, Ukraine and Russia. Senior Libyan officials, including Muammar al-Qadhafi, have told us that Libya seeks similar cooperation with the United States.

¶4. (S/NF) Comment and Action Request: We note that further information on this proposal has been provided in other, sensitive reporting. Department's guidance on South Korea's proposed civil nuclear cooperation with Libya is requested. CRETZ
