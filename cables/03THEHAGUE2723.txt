¶2.  (SBU)  While the EU has yet to make a decision on the 
upcoming Cuba resolution in the UNGA.  However, Jan Jaap 
Groenemeijer, Dutch MFA Senior Policy Advisor on Cuba, noted 
that the GoNL will support a "yes" vote during EU 
discussions.  Groenemeijer is confident that the EU will 
support the resolution, as it has done in previous years. 
The GoNL, appalled at recent human rights violations in Cuba, 
will push for a strong explanation of vote by EU members that 
demonstrates that a yes vote is not/not a vote in favor of 
Castro's regime and policies.  PolOff inquired if the Dutch 
would publicize such an explanation of vote locally in Cuba. 
Groenemeijer noted that such action was a good idea, and that 
the Dutch will consider possible ways in which to do so.
