REF: STATE 68590 
 
¶1.  (SBU) EmbOffs discussed Iceland's attendance plans for the 64th 
UN General Assembly with Greta Gunnarsdottir, head of the 
International and Security Affairs Directorate at the Icelandic MFA, 
on August 5.  Gunnarsdottir said that Iceland's plans have not yet 
been finalized; however, she was able to share preliminary thoughts 
on who would be attending.  Gunnarsdottir expects Iceland to send a 
three person delegation consisting of the Foreign Minister, the 
Political Advisor to the Minister and herself.  It does not appear 
as though Iceland will be seeking high level talks with U.S. 
officials, and the entire Icelandic contingent is expected to leave 
shortly after the Foreign Minister addresses the General Assembly.
