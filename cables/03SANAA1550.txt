¶1.  Acting Chief of the MFA's Office of International 
Organizations, Abdul Wahad Fara'a, informed PolEcon Chief on 
6/24 that the ROYG will support the U.S. candidate for 
UNESCO'S Executive Council, in the event that the election 
goes to the full membership. 
 
¶2.  At the same time, Fara'a asked that the U.S. consider 
voting for the ROYG candidate if a full membership election 
procedure is necessary for its group. The candidate, Dr. 
Hussein Abdullah al-Omari, is a former Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, Education and Agriculture, Ambassador to the U.K., 
Member of Parliament, and currently a member of the ROYG 
Consultative Council.  He is a noted author of books on 
Yemeni and Arab history. 
 
¶3.  Comment:  With UNESCO's designation of the capital city 
of Sana'a as the 2004 Cultural Capital of the Arab World, the 
ROYG would obviously appreciate having a representative on 
the Executive Council during that period.  End comment.
