¶4.  (C) SUMMARY.  OAS Secretary General Insulza convened a 
meeting at the Brazilian Mission to the UN to discuss the 
situation in Honduras.  Brazilian Foreign Minister Amorim 
summarized the previous day,s events around President 
Zelaya,s return to Honduras and refuge at the Brazilian 
embassy.  He expressed concern about a potential invasion of 
the Brazilian embassy and asked for international support to 
deter this immediate threat to peace.  Amorim said Zelaya,s 
return to Honduras was a new, important development that 
could &unblock8 the situation.  Insulza called for an 
immediate international mission.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------- 
Zelaya,s Return 
--------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) Brazilian FM Amorim offered a recap of the previous 
day,s events, which he said the press had inaccurately 
portrayed.  He said that between noon and 1:00 p.m., the 
Brazilian charge d,affaires in Tegucigalpa called and said 
that the Central American Parliament president had asked if 
the Embassy would receive Mrs. Zelaya.  The charge was 
instructed by Brasilia to receive her.  Shortly thereafter, 
the charge called again with the same question for Manuel 
Zelaya, and was instructed to receive him as well. 
 
¶6. (C) Amorim said Zelaya called him to say that he is 
committed to a peaceful approach and ask for permission to 
use the Brazilian embassy as a base for dialogue, which 
Amorim granted.  Amorim relayed his call with Secretary 
Clinton, who insisted on the importance of Zelaya maintaining 
a peaceful approach.  Amorim also relayed President Lula,s 
plea to Zelaya for calm and no provocations.  Amorim said he 
had reviewed Zelaya,s statements in the press and the only 
phrase that could be seen as provocative was &patria, 
restitucion, o muerte.8 
 
------------------------------------ 
Concerns about the Vienna Convention 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (C) The Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa received a note 
from the de facto government charging that Brazil would be 
&directly responsible8 for any violence that ensued as a 
result of provocation coming from the embassy.  Brazil did 
not respond because it does not recognize the Micheletti 
government but is concerned about the tone of the note. 
Copies were distributed. 
 
¶8. (C) Amorim reported a rumor that the Honduran Supreme 
Court would hold a special session that evening to suspend 
the Vienna Convention, allowing the de factos to arrest 
Zelaya at the Brazilian embassy.  He thanked the United 
States for our statement calling on the de facto government 
to uphold the Vienna Convention.  While recognizing that the 
OAS remains the forum for political discussions on Honduras, 
Amorim said Brazil would call for a Security Council session 
to address this immediate threat to peace.  He requested U.S. 
support as president of the Security Council.

------------------------------ 
 
¶9.  (C) A/S Shannon reported that Ambassador Llorens had 
already sent a message to Secretary Clinton describing the 
situation as worrisome.  He said the Ambassador was engaging 
with de facto leaders to allow for food, water and 
electricity.  A/S Shannon reported on his meeting with FM 
Patricia Rodas earlier that afternoon, during which he spoke 
to Zelaya by phone and confirmed that food and water had 
begun to arrive at the embassy. 
 
¶10. (C) OAS SYG Insulza stressed the need for an 
international mission immediately.  A/S Shannon expressed 
support for a mission to facilitate dialogue and send a 
strong signal to the de facto government to comply with its 
international obligations to respect the inviolability of 
diplomatic premises and personnel. 
 
¶11. (C) The Costa Rican official noted that de facto 
officials complain the San Jose Accord does not have enough 
&teeth8 to restrain Zelaya upon his return to power.  He 
suggested defining the verification commission and transition 
to power in detail would help advance a peaceful resolution. 
He also noted that Zelaya,s ongoing comments about the 
constituent assembly and extending his term to make up for 
lost days were unhelpful. 
 
¶12. (C) Amorim asserted that this crisis must be resolved 
quickly and peacefully, and while the issues raised by the 
Costa Rican official should be taken into account, they 
should not stall the process.  Amorim said Zelaya,s return 
to Honduras was a new, important development that could 
&unblock8 the situation.  All agreed to remain in close 
communication while monitoring the situation closely.
