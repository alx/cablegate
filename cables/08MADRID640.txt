SUBJECT: SPAIN/AL-KASSAR: COUNCIL OF MINISTERS APPROVES U.S
REQUEST FOR EXTRADITION

REF: A. MADRID 611
¶B. MADRID 312
¶C. MADRID 007

Classified By: Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre, Jr. for Reasons 1.4 (b) and
(d)

¶1. (C) Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba
phoned the Ambassador on June 6 to say that the Council of
Ministers had just approved the extradition to the U.S. of
notorious Syrian arms trafficker Monzer Al-Kassar. Further
to REFTELS, today's action by the Council was the final
political decision we had been awaiting since Al-Kassar was
taken into Spanish custody almost one year ago today (June 7,
2007), and is a tribute to the work of several members of the
Mission Country Team and Washington interagency.

¶2. (C) We will remain in close contact with Spanish
authorities to ensure that the transfer is made as quickly
and as securely as possible. Our understanding is that the
Council of Ministers will now issue a formal order to the
National Court (Audiencia Nacional) to authorize the transfer
of Al-Kassar. This will likely happen on Monday or Tuesday
June 9-10. Madrid DEA Country Attache spoke today with
Interpol representatives in Spain, who set Thursday June 12
as the target date for Al-Kassar to be handed over to the
U.S. Today's Council of Ministers decision is a great
victory and the definitive step towards ensuring that this
alleged terrorist faces justice in the U.S.
