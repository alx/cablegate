According to press reports, South African President Thabo 
Mbeki has distanced himself from news stories alleging that 
he had told President George W. Bush - during their meeting 
in Pretoria - that Robert Mugabe would step down in 
December.  Mbeki's denial has made headlines in the local 
press.  The July 18 edition of the government-controlled 
daily "The Herald" published a wire article by Agence 
France Presse as its lead story, under headline "Mbeki 
denies report: `There was no discussion at all about 
anybody stepping down.'"  The independent daily "The Daily 
News" (07/18) relegated the same story to page 3.  Reacting 
to reports in Britain's Independent newspaper that he 
(President Mbeki) and President Bush had discussed Mugabe's 
exit during President Bush's whistle-stop visit of Africa 
last week, SAPA news agency quotes, President Mbeki as 
having told reporters at a briefing in Pretoria: "There is 
no such thing.  I don't know where that comes 
from. . .There was no discussion at all about anybody 
stepping down."  A weekend report in Britain's Independent 
newspaper, by Zimbabwean journalist Basildon Peta, also 
said Mugabe's stepping down as leader of ZANU PF could pave 
the way for "his exit and fresh elections in 2004."
