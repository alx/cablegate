¶1.  (SBU) On September 20, Post reiterated to the Icelandic Ministry 
for Foreign Affairs the importance the USG places on Felice Gaer's 
election to the UN Committee Against Torture (Ref C).  MFA 
Minister-Counsellor for International Organization Affairs Nikulas 
Hannigan repeated the position reported Ref B that Iceland favors 
Gaer's candidacy but has not yet taken a final decision. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  In response to Ref C questions, Post notes that 
Iceland has a consistent pattern in recent years of supporting U.S. 
candidates for UN human rights-related bodies.  Post believes 
Iceland will vote for Gaer in this case and that a senior-level 
phone call will not be necessary to secure this support.  Engagement 
on the margins of UNGA with Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Solrun 
Gisladottir (who will be attending the Secretary's Transatlantic 
Dinner on September 26 as well as the Women Leaders' Working Group 
Breakfast on September 28) or Permanent Secretary of State Gretar 
Mar Sigurdsson would not be counter-productive, however.
