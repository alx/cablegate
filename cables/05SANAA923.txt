------------------------ 
Gentlemen, We've Got Him! 
------------------------- 

¶1. (S) In a conference call with Ambassador and DCM, 
President Ali Abdallah Saleh informed us last night, Tuesday, 
April 12, that suspected terrorist Kanaan has been caught. 
Saleh began with, "You know this man Kanaan who has been 
threatening you and for whose sake you closed down your 
embassy? Well, we've caught him. In fact, we also arrested, 
two days ago, two of his top assistants." Saleh went on to 
say that these arrests show the "seriousness and honesty" of 
his services and the political will at the top for full 
cooperation with "our friends the Americans." You, on the 
other hand said Saleh, "don't move on our requests." Saleh 
reassured us that his cooperation and the cooperation of his 
"services" would continue no matter what. 

----------------------- 
Now, Where's Our Stuff? 
----------------------- 

¶2. (S) Saleh did not waste time for his usual quid-pro-quo 
tactics. "So, where's my stuff? We have requested equipment 
and weapons for our CSF counter terrorism unit," said Saleh. 
"We have suffered important and costly losses in Saada and we 
need your help. Please tell Washington that this is urgent." 
"I respond to you immediately when you need something," added 
Saleh, "and now, you must do the same for me." 

--------------- 
Action Request: 
--------------- 

¶3. (S) We have presented, through military channels, a list 
of items requested by the Minister of Interior specifically 
for his CSF/CTU unit (reftel). The Ambassador will be sending 
a message separately to Centcom leadership to see about 
speeding up some material already requested through FMF 
funds. Post hereby requests Department and NSC assistance in 
having a deliverable, or two, for NSC to offer as a pat on 
the back during the planned telephone conversation later this 
week. The deliverable could be any of the items in reftel, 
but we recommend and advance on the armored vehicles which 
MOI says are urgently needed for an operation against an AQ 
target in the Ma'rib region.
