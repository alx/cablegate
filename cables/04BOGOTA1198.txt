¶1.  (C) In a February 4 meeting with Ambassador Wood and 
visiting U.S. inter-agency delegation, President Uribe stated 
that he was instructing his Administration to offer 
paramilitary leaders two options:  relocation to so-called 
"concentration zones" for those who agree to demobilize or 
prosecution (e.g., jail or death on the battlefield). 
Ambassador and DAS Peter DeShazo urged Uribe to neither lift 
the arrest orders on top paramilitary leaders, including 
Carlos Castano and Salvatore Mancuso of the AUC, nor attempt 
to change extradition laws (see para 3 reftel).  Uribe 
stressed he would not modify extradition.  Uribe added that 
if demobilized paramilitaries were to be given a temporary 
safe conduct in concentration zones they would need to be 
engaged in social service type activities.  Uribe noted that 
since he took office (August 2002), 3908 paramilitaries had 
been captured and an additional 435 had been killed. 
 
¶2.  (C) In a January 27 meeting with Ambassador and members 
of the Core Group (reftel), Peace Commissioner Restrepo had 
indicated that the GOC would not formally lift arrest 
warrants for paramilitary leaders, but intended to allow them 
freedom of movement in designated zones in order to 
facilitate demobilization (and OAS observation efforts). 
 
¶3.  (C) Comment:  Uribe is firm on his commitment not to 
touch extradition in the event of a collective paramilitary 
demobilization.  We will continue to work with the Uribe 
Administration to find a satisfactory way to deal with the 
issue of AUC members who already have arrest warrants. 
Additional items discussed in the February 4 meeting with 
Uribe will be reported septel.
