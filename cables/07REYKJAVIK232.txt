SUBJECT: Grants Support for PD Projects (Iceland) 
 
REF:  STATE 105588 
 
¶1.  The Public Affairs Section of Embassy Reykjavik receives 
excellent administrative support from the Management Section for 
post's PD programs, including grants. State is the only agency at 
post, and therefore, PAO signs only PD-related grants. 
 
¶2.  The Management Section provides PD with the usual ICASS items 
(budgetary oversight of the grants program, IRM system management, 
HR, GSO and financial management issues).  The only gap has been a 
recent lack of secretarial help.  A shared secretary among four 
officers is a position that has been unfilled for several months, 
but HR has hired a replacement, who will begin work soon. 
 
¶3. Post funding for grants has been flat for several years.  Post 
did successfully compete for additional one-time funds from EUR/PPD 
and ECA in FY2006.  The volume of grants has decreased with a 
decision, based on local input, to give larger grants to fewer 
projects.  There are adequate staff and financial resources to 
monitor the performance of grantees. 
 
¶4. In short, Reykjavik does not have any grants management 
problems.
