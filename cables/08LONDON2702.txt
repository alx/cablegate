Classified By: Political Counselor Rick Mills for reasons 1.4 b and d (C)

 HMG does not intend to participate in Iran's November 30 nuclear conference, since attendance would "give credibility" to Iran's claims about its nuclear activities, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Counterproliferation Department officer Lesley Craig told Poloff October 24. Craig said the FCO will tell anyone who contacts HMG about the conference, such as academics and NGOs, that it would be advisable not to attend. She added that the UK probably would not do a "formal demarche" to other countries regarding non-attendance; she suggested that countries likely to attend the conference would not be amenable to a demarche in any event. Separately, FCO Iran Coordination Group Regional Team Leader Rachel Martinek made comments to Poloff consistent in substance with all Craig's points.
