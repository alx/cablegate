REF: ABU DHABI 1769 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. UAE President Shaykh Zayid publicly announced on 
4/20 that the UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA) would 
fully equip six Iraqi hospitals with all necessary 
medical supplies and equipment, and donate 12 
ambulances to the Iraqi health sector.  The RCA aid 
delegation that arrived in Iraq on 4/11 (see Abu Dhabi 
1791) has identified a particular need for black fever 
serum, and testing systems for cholera and malaria. 
 
¶2.  According to press reports, the RCA already has 
contacted international pharmaceutical companies to 
purchase these items and large quantities of other 
medicines.  Comment: The RCA has requested Post's 
assistance in facilitating this shipment to Iraq, 
either by air or by sea.  We will seek to coordinate 
this effort with the RCA through the Humanitarian 
Operations Center (HOC) in Kuwait, and provide further 
details when we receive them.  End comment.
