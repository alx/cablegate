Classified By: CDA Arnold Campbell for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
(C) Charge delivered reftel points to Thordur Bjarni Gudjonsson, 
Acting Political Director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on 
February 26.  Gudjonsson said that the Icelanders would take a 
further look at this issue but that he was already familiar with the 
Russian's negative opinion of NATO expansion having served from 2000 
until 2005 as the Deputy of the Icelandic delegation to NATO.  He 
said the GOI would continue supporting the USG position in meetings 
but that it was doubtful that the GOI would make a public statement 
on the issue at this time.
