SUBJECT: SPAIN: GOVERNMENT DENIES RUMORED ETA TALKS 
 
 
¶1. (U) On June 19 conservative Spanish media outlets ABC and 
El Mundo claimed that Deputy Foreign Minister Bernardino Leon 
participated in negotiations with the Basque terrorist group 
ETA after the group ended its "permanent" cease-fire on June 
¶6. The news reports sparked strong condemnations from the 
opposition Popular Party and others who questioned whether 
the government had broken its promise to end all negotiations 
with ETA. 
 
¶2. (U) Leon rejected the allegations on June 20. Spanish 
daily El Pais (close to the Zapatero government) reported 
that "Leon has sharply denied that he participated in 
meetings with leaders of ETA on behalf of the government and 
he has said that the information published by El Mundo and 
ABC was false." According to government sources, neither Leon 
nor any member of the administration participated in the 
alleged meetings. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  COMMENT: We do not have independent confirmation of 
either of these reports.  We were not aware of any Foreign 
Ministry involvement in dealing with ETA, which is seen here 
as a domestic issue, and most contact with governments such 
as France on the subject have been through police channels. 
Spanish President Zapatero now needs to appear as tough as 
possible in dealing with ETA after the cease-fire rupture and 
in the face of intense scrutiny and criticism by the 
opposition.  He is also on the record with strong comments 
forswearing future negotiations with the terrorist group. 
Leon is a fairly prominent figure in Spanish political 
circles and has not previously, to our knowledge, been 
involved in ETA policy-making.  If the GOS were to re-engage 
in negotiations with ETA, it likely would choose a less 
visible official with previous experience on ETA.
