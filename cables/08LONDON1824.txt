REF: STATE 73171 
 
Classified By: Political Counselor Richard Mills, reasons 1.4 b, d  

¶1.  (C) HMG agrees that the Arab Group draft text on a UNSCR on Israeli settlement activity is not acceptable, FCO Near East Group Head Rob Timline told us July 9 in response to reftel demarche.  The UK embassy in Tripoli raised the issue with Libyan Secretary for Arab Affairs Mohammed Siala on July 7, and came away with the impression Siala understood the Libyan position was not helpful, Timline said.  However, only Qadhafi's opinion really matters in the end, Timline noted wryly.  

¶2.  (C/NF) The UK very much wants to avoid a confrontation (i.e. veto scenario) which would be unhelpful to all concerned, Timline said.  Nonetheless, HMG would prefer to see a UNSCR in support of the peace process go forward at this time, and not wait until September.  The UNSC hasn't addressed the issue for a long time, and a positive resolution now could be helpful.  The UK is more prepared to accept tough language on settlements than the U.S. probably is, Timline opined.  Although PM Gordon Brown is headed to Israel in two weeks' time, this is not a major factor in UK decision-making on the UNSCR, since the PM's schedule there, including a speech to the Knesset, will highlight the positive aspects of the UK-Israel relationship, Cabinet Office MEPP desk officer Brian Jones said.  

¶3.  (U) Tripoli minimize considered.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
