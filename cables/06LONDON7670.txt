DOES NOT WANT TO OPPOSE FRANCE IN UNSC

¶1.  (C) The UK shares U.S. concerns about the French draft 
UNSCR on Cote d'Ivoire (reftel) but wants to avoid being seen 
to lobby against France in the UNSC, according to FCO West 
Africa Section Head Jason Moore.  He told Poloff October 30 
that UKUN is working closely with USUN, hoping to reach an 
acceptable text closer to the language used by the African 
Union's Peace and Security Council.  Given President Gbagbo's 
proven ability to manipulate the situation, a maximalist 
approach is needed, but it must remain within international 
law and precedent, Moore said, and there is no precedent for 
a UNSCR superseding the constitution of a sovereign state 
where the UN is not the executive.  (We understand that the 
FCO Legal Adviser's office has discussed this point with L.) 
Moore said Gbagbo had written to Prime Minister Blair last 
week rejecting any formula that would set aside his country's 
national sovereignty in violation of the UN Charter. 
 
¶2.  (C) Moore found the French stance puzzling, because: 
 
- the hard line came from President Chirac personally but in 
no way implied a French willingness to serve as enforcer; 
-  in HMG's view, it is obvious that the UNSC would damage 
its credibility if it made grand pronouncements that it 
cannot or will not enforce. 
 
¶3.  (C) Moore was also surprised that France had managed to 
line up the support of African Security Council members Ghana 
and Republic of Congo, and unsure how it had succeeded in 
doing so.  (Tanzania's view is more in line with the UK's, 
according to Moore.)
