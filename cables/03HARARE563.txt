  ¶1.   Under headline "MDC lacks respect for human life" the 
      government-controlled daily "The Herald" used its March 19 
      editorial to accuse the United States of stirring up the 
      current socioeconomic and political turbulence in Zimbabwe. 
      Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .As if to give credence to claims by the white 
      Commonwealth, Britain and the United States that the 
      situation in Zimbabwe was deteriorating, the MDC has 
      gone on an orgy of violence and terror against its 
      perceived enemies.  Two innocent lives have been 
      lost so far at the hands of the MDC in the battle 
      for the Kuwadzana constituency.  While the MDC is 
      petrol-bombing its opponents, burning down buses or 
      deliberately running over innocent pedestrians and 
      firing weapons indiscriminately like lawless 
      hoodlums. . .the American Government is, on the 
      other hand, encouraging this lawlessness with its 
      renewed onslaught on Zimbabwe.  By targeting 
      sanctions on the Zimbabwean government as part of 
      measures to remove the ruling ZANU PF from power, 
      the United States has effectively provided cover to 
      the opposition to carry on with its wanton killing, 
      beatings and torture of innocent Zimbabweans. 
 
      ". . .As if to cheer the MDC on, the United States 
      started running an illegal radio station this week 
      to support dissent in Zimbabwe.  The pirate radio 
      station was also meant to give impetus to 
      yesterday's mass action. . .  The United States also 
      announced the renewal of a so-called executive order 
      by President George W. Bush renewing sanctions and a 
      freeze on alleged assets owned by President Mugabe 
      and 76 other ZANU PF officials.  The U.S. freeze has 
      been in place for more than a year but the Americans 
      know full well that there are no such assets in 
      their country.  The sanctions are, however, meant to 
      destroy the Zimbabwean economy and instead blame it 
      on the ZANU PF government.  Working with the British 
      and a few other European Union countries, the U.S. 
      has managed to squeeze the Zimbabwean economy, 
      shutting its normal offshore loans, grants and 
      investments, resulting in acute shortages of foreign 
      currency that have led to scarcity in fuel and other 
      essential imports. . . ."
