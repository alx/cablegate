SUBJECT: CNP HYPOTHESIS AS TO ILLEGAL WIRETAPS MASTERMINDS 

REF: BOGOTA 3185 AND PREVIOUS 

CLASSIFIED BY: William R. Brownfield, Ambassador; REASON: 1.4(B), 
(C), (D) 

¶1. (S/NF) XXXXXXXXXXXX  told PolCouns and XXXXXXXXXXXX  Colombia DeskOfficer on October 21 that the analysis of cell phone  calls made by the six signers of mala fide judicial telephone  intercept orders (see reftels) submitted to the Prosecutor  General's Office pointed to an individual named XXXXXXXXXXXX had received phone calls from Juan Carlos Arzayuz --former DAS Director Andres Penate's Deputy for Intelligence-- who was  arrested in July along with seven other former officials of the  Administrative Department of Security (DAS) in relation to the  wiretap scandal. XXXXXXXXXXXX said the hypothesis is that  Arzayuz  instructed Monsalve to record Supreme Court auxiliary magistrate Ivan Velazquez and leak the tape to "Semana" news magazine. The  ruse, XXXXXXXXXXXX explained, was intended to exculpate theimprisoned  Arzayuz. XXXXXXXXXXXX said the circumstances suggested this was not the  first time that Arzayuz and Monsalve had conspired to conduct  illegal wiretaps, though authorities had no developed any hard  evidence. 


¶2. (S/NF) At the time of Arzayuz' arrest, he was working at the Prosecutor General's Investigate Corps (CTI). Arzayuz made the 
switch from DAS to CTI, which XXXXXXXXXXXX found odd
given the  difference in institutional cultures, when Maria del Pilar
Hurtado  replaced Penate as DAS Director in August 2007.
XXXXXXXXXXXX said that  the CNP had not yet arrested Monsalve,
but had him under  surveillance to uncover more of his criminal
connections. Though  he had no proof, and at this time it was his mere
conjecture, XXXXXXXXXXXX said he suspected Uribe's Secretary of
the Presidency  Bernardo Moreno and possibly advisor Jose Obdulio 
Gaviria had  ordered the illegal surveillance. XXXXXXXXXXX said he 
would pursue the  investigation wherever it leads. 

¶3. (S/NF) COMMENT: This falls in the category of informed speculation, but speculation from XXXXXXXXXXXX has a pretty good track  record for success. BROWNFIELD
