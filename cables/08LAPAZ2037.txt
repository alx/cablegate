Classified By: A/DCM Mike Hammer for reasons 1.4 (b)(d)  1. (C) Embassy La Paz went to country-wide authorized departure on September 12 (reftels) due to escalating violence in the eastern departments of Bolivia (Media Luna), severe transportation restrictions/closed airports, the potential for demonstrations/attacks aimed at U.S. Mission buildings and personnel, fuel and food scarcities in the east and the potential for the same in La Paz, and the potential impact of deteriorating bilateral relations on the security of mission personnel.  The Embassy is approving country clearance requests for TDY travel to Bolivia on a case-by-case basis, approving only what is deemed essential. The Embassy asks USG personnel planning travel to or through Bolivia to please postpone trips at least until the end of the minimum period of authorized departure, October 12, and to reassess travel plans after October 13.  2. (C) The political situation in Bolivia remains fluid and unpredictable.  Post suggests USG personnel planning to travel to Bolivia check with the Bolivian Desk Officer or the Embassy's Web site and Department of State travel advisories before making plans or requesting country clearances.  The potential for political violence and unrest could continue for an indefinite period. URS
