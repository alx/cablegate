SUBJECT: TURKISH AID DELEGATION PLANS TO TRAVEL TO IRAQ 
AUGUST 21: ACTION REQUEST 
 
 
(U) Baghdad minimize considered. 
 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request -- see para 4. 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Foreign Ministry advised us late August 19 that 
a delegation including Turkish parliamentarians, Ministry of 
Public Works officials, the Turkish Red Crescent, and private 
sector representatives plans to travel by vehicle to Iraq 
August 21, en route to Baghdad and then Kirkuk to discuss 
plans to build hospitals in each city.  The Ministry said the 
Turkish Embassy in Baghdad had already contacted CPA 
authorities about the delegation, but requested -- via both a 
phone call and a diplomatic note (text in para 5) -- Embassy 
Ankara's assistance in obtaining CPA clearance. Embassy 
advised MFA that we would pass on the information to the 
Department and CPA, but that 36-hours' notice was 
insufficient to ensure the information would get to all 
relevant players. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Embassy noted that, per the non-paper given to FM 
Gul during his recent visit to Washington, the urgent need in 
the health arena was refurbishment of existing hospitals, 
along with provision of medicines. The Foreign Ministry said 
the Iraqi Red Crescent agreed on the need to construct new 
hospitals, but in any case the delegation planned to meet 
with U.S. and Iraqi advisors to the Health Ministry to 
discuss their plans during this trip. 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Action Request:  Embassy requests Department and 
CPA confirm that CPA can support this visit, and that units 
along the route be informed of the delegation's travel for 
security purposes. 
 
 
¶5.  (U) Begin Text of MFA Diplomatic Note:
