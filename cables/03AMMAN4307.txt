¶1.  (sbu) Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Deputy Governor 
Mohammad Said Shahin told ECON/C that the CBJ would 
circularize to commercial banks the list of 55 names of 
individuals whose assets must be frozen pursuant to UNSCR 
¶1483.  Banks would be instructed to freeze any such assets 
and report to the CBJ.  Shahin did not expect, however, that 
any such accounts would be located in Jordan, particularly 
given the intense search for Iraqi assets that had already 
been undertaken by the CBJ and other Jordanian authorities.
