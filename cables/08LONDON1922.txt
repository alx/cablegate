ACQUISITION OF NEW URANIUM SUPPLIES  REF: STATE 77744  

Classified By: Political Counselor Richard M. Mills, Jr. for reasons 1. 4 (b) and (d)  (C) HMG is aware that Iran could soon begin to look for international suppliers of uranium, Isabella McRae, Head of the Regional Issues Section in the Counterproliferation Department at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, told Poloff upon receipt of Reftel demarche.  She characterized the demarche as a "good reminder" on the issue, further observing that it was a "wise idea" to deliver the demarche at this time.  "Let us know if we should make similar demarches," she added.  She observed, however, that those few countries that would consider a sale of uranium to Iran would probably not be dissuaded by a demarche reminder.
