  ¶1.   The lead article in the September 8 edition of the 
      independent daily "The Daily News" concentrates on 
      an application for "Temporary Protection Status" by 
      Zimbabweans living in the United States.  Under 
      headline "Zimbabweans seek U. S. shelter," Farai 
      Mutsaka, Chief Reporter, quotes extensively from a 
      letter written by U. S. Senator Raphael Feigngold to 
      the State Department endorsing the request by the 
      Association of Zimbabweans Based Abroad (AZBA). 
      Excerpts of the article follow: 
 
  ¶2.   "The United States' State Department is considering an 
      application by Zimbabweans living in the U. S. for 
      Temporary Protection Status, which would grant illegal 
      immigrants immunity from deportation until Zimbabwe's 
      political and economic crisis is resolved, the `Daily News' 
      has established.  The AZBA, which was formed last month, 
      wrote to the U. S. State Department in August, indicating 
      that it had become unsafe for Zimbabweans living abroad to 
      return home.  U. S. Senator Raphael Feingold has also 
      written to the U. S. State Department endorsing AZBA's 
      request. . .Movement for Democratic (MDC) shadow minister 
      for foreign affairs Moses Mzila-Ndlovu said the 
      Zimbabweans' appeal was justified.  "These people are 
      directly contributing to the economy because of the foreign 
      currency that they send home.  It would be unreasonable for 
      the U. S. Government to repatriate them back home to face 
      the kind of poverty we are facing right now.  It is 
      imperative that the U. S. Government grants Zimbabwe such 
      status.'  But ZANU PF secretary for external affairs 
      Didymus Mutasa said Zimbabweans abroad were out to spread 
      lies about the conditions at home.  He said: `They are a 
      crazy gang on a mission to spread falsehoods about their 
      mother country.  Everything is normal in Zimbabwe, and 
      anyone who thinks otherwise should have his head examined. 
      They should not use silly excuses to stay in the U. S.'"
