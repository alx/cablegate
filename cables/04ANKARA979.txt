REF: ANKARA 262 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  THE TURKISH NATIONAL POLICE' 
(TNP'S) AIRPORT SECURITY DIRECTOR TOLD US THE 
NATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION SECURITY COUNCIL RECENTLY 
DISCUSSED THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S 
(DHS') AMENDMENTS ON POSTING ARMED LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS ON PLANES AND A GAP IN IMMIGRATION AND 
CUSTOMS CONTROLS FOR INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS ARRIVING 
AT TURKISH AIRPORTS.  THE COUNCIL DIRECTED GOT 
AGENCIES AND THE AIRLINES TO COMMENCE STUDIES AND 
MAKE OTHER PREPARATIONS FOR POSTING LEOS ON PLANES 
IF NECESSARY.  THE COUNCIL ALSO DECIDED TO RETURN 
TO A SYSTEM OF REQUIRING INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS 
TO CLEAR CUSTOMS AND BORDER CONTROLS AT THE FIRST 
PORT OF ENTRY, BUT WITH A FOUR TO FIVE-MONTH 
TRANSITION PERIOD.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) ECONOMIC SPECIALIST CONTACTED TNP AIRPORT 
SECURITY DIRECTOR TURGAY SAHAN ON FEBRUARY 13 FOR 
AN UPDATE ON THE GOT'S PLANS TO COMPLY WITH DHS' 
RECENT AVIATION AMENDMENTS WHICH COULD REQUIRE 
POSTING ARMED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS (LEOS) ON 
FLIGHTS TO AND OVER THE UNITED STATES, AND 
CONCERNING A LOOPHOLE IN IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS 
CONTROLS FOR INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ARRIVING AT 
TURKISH AIRPORTS (REFTEL).  SAHAN TOLD ECON 
SPECIALIST THAT THESE WERE THE MAIN AGENDA ITEMS AT 
TURKEY'S NATIONAL AVIATION SECURITY COUNCIL MEETING 
ON FEBRUARY 10. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) LEOS:  SAHAN SAID THE COUNCIL WAS HESITANT 
ON THIS ISSUE, DUE MAINLY TO A LACK OF GUIDANCE 
FROM ICAO AND TO INFRASTRUCTURE DEFICIENCIES AT 
TURKISH AIRPORTS.  SAHAN NOTED THAT ANOTHER MAJOR 
CHALLENGE THE GOT FACED IN IMPLEMENTATION WAS THE 
FINANCING OF TRAVEL, LODGING AND INSURANCE EXPENSES 
OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ON THE PLANES.  THE 
COUNCIL DECIDED TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE PREPARATIONS 
DESPITE THESE PROBLEMS.  THE COUNCIL DIRECTED THE 
AIRLINE COMPANIES TO CONDUCT A STUDY ON THE COST OF 
TRANSPORTING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, THE 
TRANSPORT MINISTRY TO PREPARE THE REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR POSTING THESE OFFICERS ON FLIGHTS AND THE 
INTERIOR MINISTRY TO PREPARE A TRAINING PROGRAM FOR 
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  SAHAN UNOFFICIALLY 
COMMENTED THAT THE GOT WAS NOT PLANNING TO PUBLICLY 
ANNOUNCE ITS STANCE REGARDING THIS ISSUE, DUE TO 
POSSIBLE NEGATIVE REACTION FROM OTHER ICAO 
COUNTRIES. 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) GAP IN BORDER CONTROLS:  THE COUNCIL ALSO 
DISCUSSED CLOSING A LOOPHOLE WHICH COULD ALLOW 
INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS TO AVOID PASSING THROUGH 
IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS CONTROLS IN SOME AIRPORTS 
(REFTEL), AND DECIDED TO GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS 
SYSTEM IN WHICH INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS WERE 
REQUIRED TO CLEAR THESE CONTROLS AT THE FIRST PORT 
OF ENTRY.  SAHAN NOTED THAT THE GOT FACED SEVERAL 
DIFFICULTIES WHEN THIS SYSTEM WAS FIRST 
IMPLEMENTED, DUE TO INSUFFICIENT PREPARATIONS AT 
THE AIRPORTS.  SAHAN SAID THAT, TO AVOID THIS 
PROBLEM, THE COUNCIL GRANTED A TRANSITION PERIOD OF 
FOUR TO FIVE MONTHS FOR GOT AGENCIES TO COMPLETE 
PREPARATIONS.  EMBASSY WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS TO 
ENSURE THE TRANSITION IS DONE IN THE SHORTEST 
POSSIBLE PERIOD.
