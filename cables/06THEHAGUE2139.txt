Classified By: Political Counselor Andrew Schofer, reasons 1.4 (b,d)

¶1. (S) Polmiloff discussed reftel points with MFA Senior
Advisor for Nuclear Affairs and Non-proliferation Ceta Noland
on September 28. Noland claimed the points did not present
any new information -- the Dutch intelligence service AIVD
has been in close contact with U.S. intelligence agencies
regarding the case, and is therefore on top of the
situation. She added that the Dutch MFA is pushing the Dutch
Ministry of Economic Affairs to issue a catch all in
connection to Aviation Services International's apparent
attempts to circumvent Dutch and EU export control
restrictions.

¶2. (S) Noland noted, however, that a catch all issuance
will be difficult, given the fact that Dutch companies are
not required under Dutch law to apply for an export license
for specific unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) components. She
said the Dutch delegation will present on this topic at the
MTCR plenary intelligence exchange in Copenhagen. Noland
welcomed additional U.S. information and cooperation on this
case, and noted that Dutch intelligence agencies will pass
any new developments to their U.S. counterparts.
