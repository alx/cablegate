LETTER CONDEMNING THE 1979 EMBASSY TEHRAN SIEGE 
 
REF: LONDON 2406 
 ¶1.  (U) On November 4, about 10 self-identified supporters of the Green Movement of Iran delivered a letter (text below) and a commemorative plaque expressing regret for the take-over of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.  London Iran Watcher accepted the items on behalf of the embassy.  A few members of the press, including VOA and Sky News, filmed the presentation.  Alireza Nourizadeh, who presented the items, made comments similar to those in the letter and expressed the group's appreciation for President Obama's statement on the thirtieth anniversary of the taking of the Embassy in Tehran.  Embassy representative made no statement.   

¶2.  (U) BEGIN TEXT OF LETTER:  The children of Adam are limbs to each other, having been created of one essence.  Mr. Barack Obama The President of the United States of American The White House Washington, DC USA   Dear Mr. President, On the 4 November 1979 a group of students calling themselves "the followers of Imam Khomenei's line" raided the American Embassy in Tehran and held its 52 members of staff for the following 444 days in what became known internationally as the "hostage crisis."  Thirty years on, the remaining leaders of the same regime that sanctioned that inhumane and disgraceful act remain in power and still instigate their rented crowd to "celebrate" the occasion across the major cities of Iran.  However, neither the Iranian regime nor the Iranian people are the same as they were 30 years ago.  Today they are the two clear and opposing poles of a nation where a minority led by a despot called Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is facing a vast majority who reject his currupt, repressive and dictatorial regime by simply aspiring for democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  The civilised and ancient Iranian people have never regarded the American people as their adversaries and indeed they look upon them as a peace and justice loving people from whose history they can derive inspirations in their own struggle for these universal and humanitarian values.  As such, in the eyes of the Iranian people, the President of the United States is seen as the rightful carrier of the beacon of freedom and justice who would never side with the enemy of those who seek to achieve and enjoy these noble causes.  We, the supporters of the Green Movement of Iran, which is leading the current upheaval of our people for freedom, condemn that hostage taking unconditionally and look forward to a future when an Iran liberated from the rule of Khamenei-Ahmadinejad's dark alliance will be the best friend of the United States to herald peace, coexistence and prosperity for mankind.  Sir, we count on your support for our just struggle.  With our sincere regards, Supporters of the Green Movement of Iran.  END TEXT OF LETTER.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX LeBaron
