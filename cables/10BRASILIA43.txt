SUBJECT: BRAZIL: AMBASSADOR PRESENTS CREDENTIALS TO PRESIDENT LULA 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: Thomas A. Shannon, Ambassador, State, Embassy 
Brasilia; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  Ambassador Shannon presented his credentials to 
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on February 4.  Lula 
indicated his continuing interest in building a strong relationship 
with President Obama and his desire for active engagement aimed at 
developing the enormous potential he sees in the broader bilateral 
relationship.  Haiti, climate change, Iran, and the Middle East 
peace process were areas he identified as ripe for Brazil-U.S. 
cooperation, and he was pleased to hear of that the Secretary, the 
Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce would be visiting 
over the next month to advance the bilateral agenda.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Joined by Acting Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota and 
Presidential Foreign Policy Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia, President 
Lula-looking fit after his hypertension episode a week 
earlier-warmly received the Ambassador in a meeting that ran well 
beyond the prescribed time for the encounter.  Throughout the 
discussion, he made clear his interest in a strong relationship 
with President Obama and his Administration.  He expressed hope 
that the President would visit Brazil soon to build on the good 
dialogue and cooperation begun last year at the Summit of the 
Americas in Trinidad and Tobago and the OAS annual meeting in San 
Pedro Sula, seeing the President's engagement as critical to a new 
quality of relationship not only with Brazil, but with Latin 
America as a whole.  Lula indicated he had high expectations for 
being able to further develop the bilateral relationship under 
President Obama, a relationship that he believes has enormous 
unexploited potential. 
 
¶3. (C) The Ambassador extended the President's greetings and his 
goal of building a strong partnership with Brazil, not only with 
regard to regional cooperation but also on the many global issues 
we are working on together.  Lula was pleased to hear that the 
Secretary, Attorney General, and Secretary of Commerce were 
planning to visit in the next month.  He said he would especially 
like U.S. climate change negotiators to visit Brazil soon;  "we 
must be well coordinated heading to Mexico," he said, referring to 
the UNFCCC COP-16. 
 
¶4. (C) The Ambassador thanked President Lula for Brazil's efforts 
and contributions in the aftermath of the earthquake in Haiti. 
Lula, clearly fully engaged on Haiti, stressed the need to put the 
United Nations and Haitian government back in charge of the 
recovery efforts.  He lamented that there was a reticence to give 
assistance directly to the GOH, for fear of corruption, but that 
much of the aid given through NGOs actually went to pay salaries 
and overhead for foreigners or staff outside Haiti.  A new way must 
be found to ensure assistance reaches Haitians, he said.  He 
described U.S. efforts and troop presence as "natural" in light of 
our proximity to Haiti, and said he saw the recovery effort going 
forward as an important opportunity for the United States and 
Brazil to collaborate.  Lula outlined his commitment to build 
Urgent Assistance Units (Unidades de Pronto Atendimento, or UPAs) 
and a field hospital in Haiti, among Brazil's other efforts. 
 
¶5. (C) Finally, Lula told the Ambassador that he is planning a 
visit to Iran in May, and that his goal in engaging is to "lower 
the temperature" on the Iran issue.  The President also mentioned 
that he will visit Israel and Palestine in March, indicating that 
he sees this as another area for potential cooperation between the 
United States and Brazil.
