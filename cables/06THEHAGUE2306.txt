PHASE
Classified By: Acting Political Counselor Jason Grubb,
reasons 1.4 (b,d)

¶1. (C) Summary: A parliamentary majority approved a
resolution October 24 to support GONL participation in the
Production, Sustainment, and Follow-on Development (PSFD)
phase of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program.
Parliamentary approval represented the last hurdle prior to
the GONL's plans to sign the PSFD MOU in Washington on
November 14. End summary.

Parliamentary Approval
----------------------

¶2. (C) The Dutch Cabinet had announced September 29 that GONL
participation in the follow-on MOU was contingent on
parliamentary approval. Parliament voted on two JSF-related
resolutions October 24. The first, sponsored by main
opposition Labor Party (PvdA) Defense Spokesperson Frans
Timmermans, called for the GONL to delay its plans to sign
the JSF follow-on MOU until after the parliamentary elections
on November 22 and subsequent formation of the new Dutch
government -- typically a three-month process. This
resolution garnered support by PvdA, GreenLeft, the Socialist
Party, and List Wilders, but fell short of obtaining a
parliamentary majority. The second motion, sponsored by CDA
Defense Spokesperson Roland Kortenhorst, supported GONL
participation in the JSF follow-on phase. GONL coalition
parties CDA and VVD were joined by List Pim Fortuyn, SGP, and
the Christian Union to form a majority approving GONL
participation in the next phase.

¶3. (C) The vote follows several days of often contentious
debate on the draft defense budget pitting Defense Minister
Kamp and MOD State Secretary van der Knaap against Timmermans
on JSF issues. Central to the debate was a recent report
released by the Dutch equivalent of the Government
Accountability Office, which described GONL participation in
JSF as fraught with financial risks, but ultimately saw no
reason to withdraw from the program. Timmermans and PvdA
colleagues acknowledged that JSF is the best available option
to replace the Dutch Air Force's F-16 fleet, but argued in
favor of buying JSF off-the-shelf instead of program
participation. Timmermans cited figures from the Dutch GAO
report noting that the cost of the program had ballooned to
the point that continued participation would be tantamount to
""signing a blank check,"" and such money could be better spent
on ""nursing homes.""

¶4. (C) Kamp and van der Knaap argued the Dutch GAO report
mistakenly included operational with acquisition costs, thus
""comparing apples with oranges."" They acknowledged the
obvious risks associated with the program, but these risks
have not changed since the Netherlands intially chose to
participate in the program. Van der Knaap noted the obvious
benefits program participation would have for Dutch defense
industry while significantly improving Dutch defense
capabilities. He also said the new Dutch government could
choose to withdraw from the MOU following the elections.

Sorry, Charlie...
-----------------

¶5. (C) Perhaps faced with the increasing likelihood of a
parliamentary majority in favor of JSF follow-on
participation, PvdA released an election campaign cartoon
parody depicting three party members (Attje Kuiken, Mei-Li
Vos, and Nebahat Albayrak) as Charlie's Angels assigned by
PvdA Leader Wouter Bos to foil the JSF program. The cartoon
shows these PvdA Angels snatching a case labeled ""JSF
millions"" from PM Balkenende just before handing it over to
President Bush. Those that viewed the cartoon on the website
""YouTube"" gave it two out of five stars.

MOU Signature on Course
-----------------------

¶6. (C) With parliamentary approval now on the books, the GONL
is now set to sign the follow-on MOU in Washington on
November 14. Van der Knaap and Trade Minister van Gennip
plan to represent the GONL at the signing ceremony.
