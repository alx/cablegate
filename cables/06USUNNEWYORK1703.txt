SUBJECT: COUNCIL APPROVES UN DARFUR FORCE BY COUNT OF 
12-0-3 WITH 9 CO-SPONSORS 
 
REF: A. WWW.UN.ORG/NEWS/PRESS/DOCS/2006/SC8821.DOC.HT M 
 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 143865 
 
¶1. (U) In an August 31 formal meeting, the Security Council 
adopted the UK-U.S. draft resolution expanding UNMIS' mandate 
into Darfur.  The draft included nine co-sponsors: Argentina, 
Denmark, France, Ghana, Greece, Slovakia, Tanzania, the UK 
and the U.S.  The final vote count was 12 votes in favor, 
zero opposed and three abstentions by China, Qatar and 
Russia.  Thirteen members gave Explanations of Vote (EOVs) 
after the vote; statements can be found ref A.  The 
resolution was adopted as UN document S/RES/1706 (2006); text 
in Para 5. 
 
¶2. (SBU) UN Department of Political Affairs 
Assistant-Secretary-General Kalomoh and the Charge of the 
Sudanese Mission also attended the formal meeting. 
Co-sponsors of the text materialized at the last minute, but 
noticeably absent was African Union Chair Congo's 
co-sponsorship, despite interventions by our delegation and 
by the French, who less than 12 hours earlier had received 
assurances from Brazzaville that Congo would do so. 
Congolese PermRep Ikouebe told Ambassador Bolton he had 
received instructions from his capital just prior to the 
meeting to vote in favor of the resolution but not to 
co-sponsor it, an unsurprising result after Ikouebe's 
defensive posture in August 30 Sudan consultations, which in 
turn likely resulted from a series of stern demarches in 
Brazzaville.  The Peruvian delegation confessed its reasons 
for not co-sponsoring were purely circumstantial, as August 
30-31 were Peruvian national holidays, making leaders in Lima 
impossible to reach. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Despite initial indications from Moscow that the 
Russian delegation might vote for the resolution, 11th-hour 
instructions were given to Russian PermRep Churkin (who was 
accordingly late to the meeting) to join his Chinese and 
Qatari counterparts in abstaining.  COMMENT: Russian PermRep, 
DPR and staff explained that they had fought hard to win 
Moscow's approval of the resolution and indeed predicted a 
favorable vote as late as yesterday evening.  They explained 
today, however, that strong Chinese lobbying in Moscow had 
derailed their efforts. 
 
¶4. (SBU) China, Qatar and Russia in their EOVs attributed 
their abstentions to the timing of the resolution's adoption, 
rather than to its content.  The Qatari delegation told USUN 
privately that it viewed the re-wording of the reference to 
Sudanese consent for UN Darfur deployment in OP1 ('and 
therefore invites the consent of the Government of National 
Unity for the deployment') as making the resolution worse, 
particularly from their legal perspective.  Qatar feared that 
such a formulation left open the possibility for the Sudanese 
government to be accused of non-compliance with UNSCR 1706 in 
the event it fails to give its consent to the UN deployment, 
an interpretation Qatar noted had already been cited by the 
Ghanaian delegation (which had favored no mention of the need 
for consent at all). 
 
¶5. (U) Begin UNSCR 1706 text: 
 
The Security Council, 
 
Recalling its previous resolutions concerning the situation

USUN NEW Y 00001703  002 OF 006 
 
 
Recalling also its previous resolutions 1325 (2000) on women, 
peace and security, 1502 (2003) on the protection of 
humanitarian and United Nations personnel, 1612 (2005) on 
children and armed conflict, and 1674 (2006) on the 
protection of civilians in armed conflict, which reaffirms 
inter alia the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 
2005 United Nations World Summit outcome document, as well as 
the report of its Mission to the Sudan and Chad from 4th to 
10th June 2006, 
 
Reaffirming its strong commitment to the sovereignty, unity, 
independence, and territorial integrity of the Sudan, which 
would be unaffected by transition to a United Nations 
operation in Darfur, and to the cause of peace, expressing 
its determination to work with the Government of National 
Unity, in full respect of its sovereignty, to assist in 
tackling the 
various problems confronting the Sudan and that a United 
Nations operation in Darfur shall have, to the extent 
possible, a strong African participation and character, 
 
Welcoming the efforts of the African Union to find a solution 
to the crisis in Darfur, including through the success of the 
African Union-led Inter-Sudanese Peace Talks on the Conflict 
in Darfur in Abuja, Nigeria, in particular the framework 
agreed between the parties for a resolution of the conflict 
in Darfur (the Darfur Peace Agreement), commending the 
efforts of the signatories to the Darfur Peace Agreement, 
expressing its belief that the Agreement provides a basis for 
sustained security in Darfur, reiterating its welcome of the 
statement of 9 May 2006 by the representative of the Sudan at 
the United Nations Security Council Special 
Session on Darfur of the Government of National Unity's full 
commitment to implementing the Agreement, stressing the 
importance of launching, with the African Union, the 
Darfur-Darfur Dialogue and Consultation as soon as possible, 
and recognising that international support for implementation 
of the Agreement is critically important to its success, 
 
Commending the efforts of the African Union for the 
successful deployment of the African Union Mission in the 
Sudan (AMIS), as well as the efforts of Member States and 
regional and international organisations that have assisted 
it in its deployment, and AMIS' role in reducing large-scale 
organised violence in Darfur, recalling the decision of the 
African Union Peace and Security Council of 10 March 2006, 
and its decision of 27 June 2006, as outlined in paragraph 10 
of its Communique, that the African Union is ready to review 
the mandate of AMIS in the event that the ongoing 
consultations between the Government of National Unity and 
the United Nations conclude on an agreement for a transition 
to a United Nations peacekeeping operation, 
stressing the need for AMIS to assist implementation of the 
Darfur Peace Agreement until transition to the United Nations 
force in Darfur is completed, welcoming the decision of the 
African Union Peace and Security Council of 27 June 2006 on 
strengthening AMIS' mandate and tasks, including on the 
protection of civilians, and considering that AMIS needs 
urgent reinforcing, 
 
Reaffirming its concern that the ongoing violence in Darfur 
might further negatively affect the rest of the Sudan as well 
as the region, in particular Chad and the Central African 
Republic, and stressing that regional security aspects must 
be addressed to achieve long lasting peace in Darfur, 
 
Remaining deeply concerned over the recent deterioration of 
relations between the Sudan and Chad, calling on the 
governments of the two countries to abide by their 
obligations under the Tripoli Agreement of 8 February 2006 
and the agreement between the Sudan and Chad signed in 
N'djamena on 26 July 2006 and to begin implementing the 
 
USUN NEW Y 00001703  003 OF 006 
 
 
confidence building measures which they have voluntarily 
agreed upon, welcoming the recent re-establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the Sudan and Chad, and calling 
upon all States in the region to co-operate in ensuring 
regional stability, 
 
Re-iterating its strong condemnation of all violations of 
human rights and international humanitarian law in Darfur, 
and calling upon the Government of National Unity to take 
urgent action to tackle gender based violence in Darfur 
including action towards implementing its Action Plan to 
Combat Violence Against Women in Darfur with particular focus 
on the rescission of Form 8 and access to legal redress, 
 
Expressing its deep concern for the security of humanitarian 
aid workers and their access to populations in need, 
including refugees, internally displaced persons and other 
war-affected populations, and calling upon all parties, in 
particular the Government of National Unity, to ensure, in 
accordance with relevant provisions of international law, the 
full, safe and unhindered access of relief personnel to all 
those in need in Darfur as well as the delivery of 
humanitarian assistance, in particular to internally 
displaced persons and refugees, 
 
Taking note of the communiques of 12 January, 10 March, 15 
May and 27 June 2006 of the Peace and Security Council of the 
African Union regarding transition of AMIS to a United 
Nations operation, 
 
Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on Darfur 
dated 28 July 2006 (S/2006/591), 
 
Determining that the situation in the Sudan continues to 
constitute a threat to international peace and security,

order to support the early and effective implementation of 
the Darfur Peace Agreement, that UNMIS' mandate shall be 
expanded as specified in paragraphs 8, 9 and 12 below and 
that it shall deploy to Darfur, and therefore invites the 
consent of the support of the Government of National Unity 
for this deployment, and urges member states to provide the 
capability for an expeditious deployment;

Expresses its intention to consider authorising possible

Agreement or commits human rights violations; 
 
Decides to remain seized of the matter.
