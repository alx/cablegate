SUBJECT: SPAIN: FOLLOW-UP ON MADRID DONORS' CONFERENCE FOR 
IRAQ 
 
REF: STATE 31782 
 
¶1. We met February 13 with Ministry of Economy officials 
Ramon Guzman, Director General for Trade and Investments, and 
Carlos Jimenez, Director General for Commercial Policy, to 
discuss reftel.  Both participate regularly in the Core Group 
conference calls.  According to Guzman and Jimenez, the GOS' 
$220 million pledge in Madrid breaks down as follows: 
 
¶2. Year 2004 (Note: all but the final $17 million have been 
programmed) 
Total: $60 million 
IRFFI: $20 million 
Production of Iraqi Dinars: $18 million 
IFC Small Business Facility: $5 million 
Still unprogrammed: $17 million (Note: the GOS is considering 
using this money to pay for production of Iraqi visas) 
 
¶3. Years 2005-07 (Note: this allocation is notional and will 
likely change) 
Total: $160 million 
Ministry of Economy non-reimbursable credit lines (FAD): $75 
million 
Bilateral donations (from the Spanish International Aid 
agency, regional and local governments, etc.): $65 
Technical assistance (not further specified): $10 million 
Unprogrammed: $10 million 
 
¶4. Guzman confirmed that, as agreed in the Core Group calls, 
the GOS has been encouraging other donors to commit the funds 
pledged in Madrid.  Jimenez, and possibly Guzman, will attend 
the February 28-29 IRFFI donors meeting in Abu Dhabi.  This 
could be a good opportunity to coordinate with the Spanish on 
outreach to other countries regarding disbursement and 
coordination of pledges.
