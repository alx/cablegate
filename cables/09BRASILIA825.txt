SUBJECT: BRAZIL'S FIGHTER COMPETITION: AMBASSADOR'S 
CONVERSATION WITH MOD JOBIM 
 
REF: BRASILIA 795 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Clifford Sobel.  Reason 1.4(D) 
 
¶1.  (C)  In a private June 26 meeting with Ambassador Sobel 
on the margins of a lunch including Presidential Advisors 
Marco Aurelio Garcia and Gilberto Carvalho, MOD Jobim said he 
believes he has the information he needs to discuss Brazil's 
fighter purchase with President Lula once the Air Force makes 
a recommendation.  Jobim told the Ambassador that he expects 
to receive the Air Force's position in July, after which he 
will be able "to speak politically."  Jobim emphasized that 
tech transfer would be the key factor in Brazil's decision, 
although he declined to be drawn into discussing whether he 
thought Boeing's tech transfer offer the best.  He did say 
that he was convinced Boeing was "sincere" in its offer. 
Ambassador Sobel asked whether, in the event that the Air 
Force recommended the Super Hornet, Jobim would endorse the 
recommendation.  The Minister said he had the information he 
needed to support the Super Hornet.  He cautioned that he 
does not currently know "where Lula is" on the matter. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Turning to the question of industrial cooperation, 
Jobim believed that there was increasing interest in Boeing's 
offset package.  He reported that he had recently discussed 
the issue with Embraer President Frederico Curado who had 
said Embraer's priority was job creation and that Curado was 
interested in what he described as building partnership with 
Boeing.  Jobim was also impressed by the breadth of Boeing's 
prospective industrial cooperation, encompassing major firms 
such as Embraer and Avibras, companies with strong political 
connections such as Santo Labs, and even a business in Porto 
Allegre, in Jobim's home state of Rio Grande do Sul.  Jobim 
said he planned to meet with Boeing officials in early July 
to learn more about the offset package. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Embassy Comment. Embassy believes Jobim's remarks 
were intended to convey the sense that Boeing is in a strong 
position to come out of the Air Force phase of the selection 
process as a front runner.  Should it do so, Jobim will 
likely be willing to offer his support.  The key decision, 
however, will be with the National Defense Council, in 
particular President Lula.  Should Lula prefer one of the 
competitors, it is likely Jobim would go along.  For this 
reason, USG enagement with Brazil at the highest levels 
assumes even greater importance as we have a narrowing window 
to influence the fianl decision.
