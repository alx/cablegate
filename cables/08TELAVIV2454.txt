SUBJECT: ISRAEL MEDIA REACTION 
 
-------------------------------- 
SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
U.S. Elections 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media led with and extensively reported on Election Day in the 
U.S.  A headline in Yediot reads: QMcCain Is Everything that America 
Has Believed in; Obama Belongs to the New America.Q  The Jerusalem 
Post quoted Israeli experts as saying that Sen. Obama will win the 
Jewish vote.  Major media reported that a turning Democratic tide is 
expected to sweep more Jews into Congress. 
 
HaQaretz reported that Britain is pressing the EU to be stricter 
about labeling imports produced in West Bank settlements, leading 
Jerusalem officials to fear a confrontation with London over the 
settlements issue.  They say the latest moves are aimed at applying 
diplomatic pressure on Israel in a bid to stop construction in the 
settlements. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Likud has issued a clear policy 
directive against Israeli talks with Iran to advisers of both U.S. 
presidential candidates, as well as to representatives of the State 
Department.  Major media reported that MK Yuval Steinitz is behind 
this initiative.  Yediot reported that Yuval Rabin, the son of the 
assassinated PM, is considering voting for Benjamin Netanyahu. 
 
 
Leading media reported that on Sunday PA President Mahmoud Abbas 
ruled out the possibility of clinching a peace agreement with Israel 
by the end of the year. 
 
Leading media reported that, despite the High Court of Justice's 
recommendation to consider amending the indictment filed against 
Lt.-Col. Omri Burberg and one of his subordinates, who were involved 
in firing at a bound Palestinian detainee during an anti-security 
fence demonstration, the Military Judge Advocate Brig.-Gen. Avichai 
Mandelblit decided to charge them with the sole count of conduct 
unbecoming an officer. 
 
All media reported that yesterday Nachman Shai, chairman of the 
United Jewish Communities and former IDF Spokesman, announced that 
he was joining Kadima and would run in the party's primaries for the 
Knesset. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that, citing a delay resulting from last 
yearQs teachersQ strike, the Education Ministry came under hash 
criticism for failing to issue required matriculation certificates 
to dozens of Israeli-Arab students hoping to begin their university 
studies in Jordan. 
 
Leading media reported that 150 employees of the local Kodak plant 
were fired and that the production line was sent to China.

U.S. Elections:

Summary: 
-------- 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: QIsrael, which 
says it is looking for a partner on the Arab side, must also examine 
the nature of the new American partner, because without him, it will 
have trouble finding an Arab partner who will agree to serious 
negotiations. 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: QThe 
Qbest president for IsraelQ is the man who can best internalize the 
scale of the Iranian menace, and most effectively persuade Americans 
-- and responsible players in the international community -- to stop 
the mullahs before it's too late. 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Shimon Shiffer wrote in the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: QIf [Obama] gets 
elected, Israeli pressure [about Iran] will not fall on attentive 
ears. 
 
Military correspondent Amos Harel wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning HaQaretz: QIt's hard to ask Israelis to look at the 
wider picture with the threat of an Iranian bomb floating overhead, 
but an Obama victory would have a plethora of positive implications 
that don't necessarily have any connection to the Middle East. 
 
Editor-in-Chief Amnon Lord wrote on page one of the nationalist, 
Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe: Q[ObamaQs] victory will be a reminder 
of the euphoria mingled with hatred that occurred in Israel with 
Ehud BarakQs victory over Netanyahu 1n 1999.  The talk was about 
hope and peace -Q what we got was a war of terror, fear, and 
enmity.

¶I.  "Change Needed in the U.S." 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (11/4): 
QIsrael, which says it is looking for a partner on the Arab side, 
must also examine the nature of the new American partner, because 
without him, it will have trouble finding an Arab partner who will 
agree to serious negotiations.... The two presidential candidates, 
Democratic Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and Republican Senator 
John McCain of Arizona, have made a point of demonstrating their 
commitment to Israel's security.  Neither, it may be believed, would 
deviate from the brave alliance between the two countries.  However, 
after eight years of a conservative Republican president, the 
question arises: Has the time come for a new American policy in the 
region?  A policy that will afford diplomacy a major role, that will 
back serious negotiations with Iran, that will assist the 
negotiations between Israel and Syria and will extend practical 
support to the Arab initiative and to ending the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict?  This kind of new policy needs a new leader to conduct it, 
a leader who is not committed to his predecessor's ideological 
fetters and is prepared to listen seriously to new ideas.  Israel 
should hope for this kind of leader. 
 
 
II.  "America Decides" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (11/4): 
QOn Iran, Obama views the regime as a threat to the U.S. and would 
employ direct diplomacy to persuade Teheran to change its policies. 
If that didn't work, he says, all options are on the table.  McCain 
promises to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, has pushed for 
restricting Teheran's ability to import refined petroleum, and 
pledges not to talk to the regime without pre-conditions.  He's 
criticized Obama for his willingness to enter into unconditional 
negotiations.  With regard to negotiations between Israel and the 
Palestinians, Obama would take an activist approach to help reach an 
agreement, but would not dictate the terms of peace.... McCain, like 
Obama, supports the creation of a Palestinian state.  He says he 
would never force Israel into concessions with anyone that seeks its 
destruction.  He has made no statement on the 1967-plus formula. 
He's promised to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to 
Jerusalem.... Americans now decide whether to vote QCountry First 
or QChange We Need.Q  Those who would factor Israel into their 
decision understand that our preeminent strategic concern is the 
Iranian threat.  The Qbest president for IsraelQ is the man who can 
best internalize the scale of the Iranian menace, and most 
effectively persuade Americans -- and responsible players in the 
international community -- to stop the mullahs before it's too 
late. 
 
III.  "On the Way to Iran" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Shimon Shiffer wrote in the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (11/4): QIf [Obama] gets 
elected, Israeli pressure [about Iran] will not fall on attentive 
ears.  Senior officials in the current U.S. administration have 
explained to their Israeli counterparts that returning to Tehran 
will expose the extent to which the Iranian people want the 
resumption of ties with the QGreat Satan.Q  QLines for U.S. visas 
will be the blaring evidence of the justness of the move,Q said the 
senior officials.  Khaled Mashal, the Chairman of HamasQs political 
bureau, who appears on the blacklist of many countries around the 
world, will also enjoy ObamaQs election.  It can be assumed that the 
ban on U.S. representatives to contact Hamas will be canceled. 
Behind the laundered code name that appears in Barak ObamaQs 
diplomatic dictionary Q- QengagementQ Q- stands the change that will 
influence the new U.S. administrationQs relations with Israel: Obama 
will not have figures, movements, or countries beyond the fence. 
The U.S. presidentQs envoys will hold contacts with everyone.... 
But, despite everything, one must remember the circle closest to 
Obama includes at least three figures from the Chicago Jewish 
community who have been at his side since he began his course.  They 
will be also there during the harsh days of the relationship with 
Israel. 
 
IV.  "Between Tehran and Mississippi" 
 
Military correspondent Amos Harel wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning HaQaretz (11/4): QSupport for Israel is rooted deep in 
the heart of the Washington establishment.  And, of course, we can't 
scoff at the declarations of the candidate [Obama] himself, who has 
reiterated his commitment to Israel.  But there is one unknown in 
Obama's foreign-policy equation: his attitude toward Iran. 
Officials in Jerusalem won't say it out loud, but Obama's support 
for renewing the dialogue with Tehran is making them very 
uncomfortable.... It's hard to ask Israelis to look at the wider 
picture with the threat of an Iranian bomb floating overhead, but an 
Obama victory would have a plethora of positive implications that 
don't necessarily have any connection to the Middle East, such as 
for interracial relations in the U.S. and America's image around the 
world.  Even more important: Obama is poised to become president of 
a country where just 50 years ago in some states a black man risked 
being hung on the nearest tree merely for looking at a white woman; 
a place where just 45 years ago Jewish civil rights activists were 
murdered, their bodies thrown into a Mississippi delta swamp for 
registering and encouraging black voters; where Martin Luther King, 
Jr. was murdered by a white racist for daring to argue that blacks 
deserved equal rights. 
 
¶V.  QGambling on Hope 
 
Editor-in-Chief Amnon Lord wrote on page one of the nationalist, 
Orthodox Makor Rishon-Hatzofe (11/4): QIt should be said that those 
who read commentators and editorialists, in particular those of 
right-wing newspapers in America, get the impression of acceptance 
of a one-party regime in Washington, headed by President Obama.  If 
it turns out tomorrow that this is the American peopleQs decision, 
there is room for wholeheartedly saluting that people.... Until the 
mid-60s most African Americans did not have the right to vote.... 
[But ObamaQs] foreign policy is enigmatic and fraught with dangers. 
A man who has befriended such spurious characters has never before 
been elected president.  His victory will be a reminder of the 
euphoria mingled with hatred that occurred in Israel with Ehud 
BarakQs victory over Netanyahu in 1999.  The talk was about hope and 
peace -Q what we got was a war of terror, fear, and enmity.
