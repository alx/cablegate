Classified By: CLASSIFIED BY POLITICAL COUNSELOR GREG BERRY FOR REASONS  1.4 (B) AND (D).  

¶1. (C//NF) Poloff had an introductory call with Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO)  Levant team leader Nishi Dholakia on November 20.  Poloff used the opportunity to reinforce Washington,s points on resolutions against Israel (ref A) which were previously delivered to the FCO International Organization Department,s UN Team (ref B).  

No Change of Position Without Progress -------------------------------------------  

¶2. (C//NF) Dholakia confirmed what we heard from his colleagues in the IO Department in terms of HMG,s agreement with the U.S. evaluation of the Goldstone report and on the FCO,s position that an abstention was &less confrontational8 with Arab States.  He also stressed that until such time as there is &real progress8 on peace process negotiations HMG will not change its voting on any resolution similar to one on which it had voted previously. To do so would send a &clear sign of approval for Netanyahu,8 which HMG had no intention of giving, particularly in the wake of Israel,s announcement of 900 new tenders for housing units in Gilo, he added.  

EU Unity a Priority -------------------  

¶3. (C//NF) Dholakia indicated that in addition to continuing to vote as they have in the past that seeking and hopefully maintaining EU unity on these issues remained a top FCO priority.  There was a &widely held belief8 that the perceived split among EU member state,s reactions to Goldstone was &quite harmful.8   A conscious effort is being made to mend the rift and to avoid such divergences in the future.  

U.S. Leading the Way ------------------------  

¶4. (C//NF) Dholakia made it clear that HMG is &looking to the U.S.8 to really &take the lead8 on moving the negotiations forward, adding that the FCO hopes that any return to negotiations will be accompanied by a &very strong statement of USG involvement8 and at least &some articulation regarding a vision of the end game.8  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
