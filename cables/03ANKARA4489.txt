SUBJECT:  Delivery of Treasury Letter on Iraqi Assets and 
List of Names for Asset Freeze List 
 
 
REF:  (A) State 186972 (B) State 196163 
 
 
(SBU) Econoff and Econ Specialist delivered a copy of ref A 
letter from Treasury Secretary Snow concerning recovery of 
Iraqi assets and the list of 55 names of individuals whose 
assets must be frozen under UN Security Council Resolution 
1483 (ref B) to Akif Ayhan, MFA Deputy Director General for 
Bilateral Economic Affairs, and to the Finance Ministry. 
Ayhan told us that the GOT has not found any Iraqi assets as 
yet in the Turkish financial system, but noted that the 
provision of names in ref B should assist in the search.  He 
also stated that MFA would share this information with the 
central bank, the Turkish Treasury and the Finance Ministry 
as part of a renewed effort to locate Iraqi assets.
