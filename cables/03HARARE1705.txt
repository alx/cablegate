  ¶1.   The United States Institute of Peace is reported to 
      have accused the United States and the European 
      Union (EU) of trying to isolate Zimbabwe.  Under 
      headline "ZANU PF rule unavoidable: U. S. report," 
      the August 28 edition of the government-controlled 
      daily "The Herald" carried the article by Lovemore 
      Chikova on page one: 
 
  ¶2.   "Many Zimbabweans feel ZANU PF rule is unavoidable 
      because of the party's ability to address historical 
      grievances and its liberations credentials, research 
      by the United States Institute of Peace has 
      revealed. .  .In a report on Zimbabwe titled 
      `Zimbabwe and the Prospects for Non-violent 
      Political Change' released this month the institute 
      said ZANU PF's commitment to ratifying colonial 
      imbalances appealed to the majority.  `Since 
      independence in 1980, the ruling ZANU PF government 
      has used its anti-colonial legacy and its role in 
      the war of liberation to build a nationalist 
      platform with a stated commitment to rectifying 
      colonial injustice. . .The theme garners support 
      from many leaders in developing countries and 
      Zimbabwe's rural populace.  The party's incumbency, 
      its ability to capitalize on historic grievances and 
      its liberation credentials makes many Zimbabweans 
      feel that ZANU PF's continued involvement in any 
      government is inevitable," (said the institute). 
      The U. S. institute, linked to the local Mass Public 
      Opinion founded by the late government critic 
      Professor Masipula Sithole, said sanctions imposed 
      on the country by some Western countries had stifled 
      its ability to grow. . .  `Sanctions have severely 
      undermined the Zimbabwe government's ability to 
      deliver social services - most donors have stopped 
      their assistance, except for humanitarian relief and 
      HIV/AIDS programs. . .The United States and the 
      European Union have tried to isolate Zimbabwe, but 
      the government continues to enjoy friendly relations 
      with various countries around the globe. . .The 
      imposition of `smart sanctions' and the withdrawal 
      of international donor support that followed have 
      crippled the government's ability to resuscitate the 
      economy,' said the institute."
