¶1. Action request, see Paragraph 4.  

¶2. (SBU) HM Treasury has passed us names of individuals and groups for which it is requesting any and all updated information, identifiers and statements of cases (SOCs) in order to comply with it's 2007 policy to conduct yearly reviews of all designated parties.  HMT told us that in some of the early cases (i.e., immediately post-9/11), HMG essentially designated automatically based on the USG request.  At that time, neither government had developed detailed SOCs or the more nuanced legal structures that we have now.  Now, under pressure from legal challenges, the UK will need relatively current information (within the past two or three years) of terrorist or terrorist finance-related activity, or strong evidence of involvement in egregious actions (i.e., masterminds of 9/11 or the 7/7 London bombings), in order to maintain the designations.  

¶3. (SBU) HMG is also asking its own police and intelligence services for the same information.  If past practice repeats itself, this request may also be made to the USG through other channels.  HMT has given us two categories of lists. The first is the highest priority, and involves individuals that have only been designated within the UK using British domestic authority.  The UK domestic asset freezing regime is being reviewed by a Court of Appeals, so HMT is trying to finish these reviews as quickly as possible in case the court rules against them.  In addition to their UK domestic designation, the second group of names have been designated by the UN 1267 Committee.  This provides the UK with an alternate legal structure to continue freezing their assets if the domestic regime is overturned.  For that reason, information on the second group is not as urgent.  The British government does not have a deadline for receiving this information, but would appreciate it as quickly as possible.  They fully understand and appreciate the burdens this request places on USG resources.  

¶4. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: Please supply any recent information (unclassified is preferred, but classified would also be useful) on the individuals and groups below, including: identifiers, updated SOCs, locations, status of court cases, and whether entities are still legally funtioning or, if known, whether an individual is deceased.  HMT officials would particularly appreciate an update on the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development.  If the group has been wound up within the UK, as their information indicates, the UK would no longer be able to maintain an asset freeze on the group.  According to HMG records, none of the individuals have funds or accounts within the UK.  Embassy London thanks Washington agencies and players for their support of this request.  Highest priority: UK Domestic Designations only (sent by e-mail, Reftel)        AL-ALMI, Iamd Khalil       BARAKAT, Assad Ahmad       HAMDAN, Usama       MARZOUK, Musa Abu       MISHAAL, Khalid       AL-MUGHASSIL, Ahmad Ibrahim       AL-NASSER, Abdelkarim Hussein Mohamed       AL-YACOUB, Ibrahim Salih Mohammed       ATWA, Ali       EL-HOORIE, Ali Saed Bin Ali       IZZ-AL-DIN, Hasan       MOHAMMED, Khalid SHAIKH       Aum Shinrikyo       Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development       Kahane Chai       National Liberation Army       Palestine Liberation Front       Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine       Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command       Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)       Shining Path       United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia       Elehssan  Secondary priority: UK and UN 1267 Designations (not previously forwarded to Washington)  ABDUL CHAUDHRY, Majeed  ABDURRAHMAN, Mohamad Iqbal AL-AOUADI, Mohamed Ben Belgacem Ben Abdallah AL-CHARAABI, Tarek Ben Al-Bechir Ben Amara AL-GHOZI, Fathur Rohman AL-JAZIRI, Abu Bakr AL-ZINDANI, Abd-al-majid Aziz BASHIR-UD-DIN, Mahmood Sultan BEN HANI, Al As'ad BIN ABDUL HAQ, Huda BOUCHOUCHA, AL-Mokhtar Ben Mohamed Ben Al-Mokhtar DARWISH, Sulayman Khalid  DWIKARNA, Agus EL-SAYED, Abd El Kader Mahmoud Mohamed ELSSEID, Sami Ben Khamis Ben Saleh ISAMUDDIN, Nurjaman Riduan MUNANDAR, Aris MURAD, Abdul Hakim SAMUDRA, Imam SIREGAR, Parlindungan SYAWAL, Yassin TANTOUSH, Ibrahim Ali Abu Bakr TUFAIL, Mohammed YUNOS, Mukhlis  Waldenberg AG Afghan Support Committee Aid Organization of the Ulema Ansar Al-Islam Benevolence International Foundation Benevolence International Fund Bosanska Idealna Futura Global Relief Foundation Islamic International Brigade Jama'at Al-Tawhid Wa'al-Jihad Jemaah Islamiyah Lashkar E Tayyaba Lashkar I Jhangvi Revival of Islamic Heritage Society Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs Special Purpose Islamic Regiment Emmah Tameer E-Nau  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX TUTTLE
