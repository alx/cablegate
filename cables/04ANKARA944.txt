of the Visa Department at the MFA, Chief of Section reviewed

from members of parliament required to be fingerprinted when 
applying for a tourist visa.  The issue was raised directly 
with the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  Mr. Aca requested

in a non-official capacity be exempt from the fingerscanning 
process when applying for a visa.

related to fingerscanning and the U.S. Visit program.  Mr.

terms the requirements for inclusion and clarified that 
Turkey was not qualified to participate at this time. 
 
 
¶4.   Post requests department consider the Turkish view when 
considering possible changes to the current policy regarding 
fingerscanning of diplomatic passport holders regardless of 
visas category.
