SUBJECT: HOLY SEE RELAYS CONCERNS ABOUT SITUATION IN 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO; SEEKS U.S. SUPPORT 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU) THE HOLY SEE OUTLINED ITS CONCERNS ABOUT MOUNTING 
UNREST IN THE NORTHEASTERN REGION OF ITURI  IN THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC) IN A NOTE PASSED TO EMBASSY MARCH 24. 
 THE VATICAN IS CALLING ON THE PARTIES TO "RESPECT AGREEMENTS 
ALREADY SIGNED AND RESUME NEGOTIATIONS."  THE HOLY SEE, WITH 
CLERGY IN COMMUNITIES ON ALL SIDES OF THIS MULTIFACETED 
    CONFLICT, IS CLEARLY CONCERNED THAT RECENT GAINS IN THE CONGO 
PEACE PROCESS ARE AGAIN AT RISK FROM THE MILITARY OCCUPATION 
OF BUNIA BY THE UGANDAN ARMED FORCES.  THEY HAVE ASKED US TO 
BRING THEIR CONCERNS TO THE DEPARTMENT'S ATTENTION AND WOULD 
APPRECIATE U.S. SUPPORT FOR THEIR POSITION AS OUTLINED IN 
THEIR PRO-MEMORIA NOTE TO ENCOURAGE ADHESION TO THE 
AGREEMENTS AND RESUMPTION OF NEGOTIATIONS. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  THE TEXT OF THE NOTE FOLLOWS: 
 
BEGIN TEXT: 
 
IN RECENT TIMES, THE ALREADY COMPLICATED SITUATION IN THE 
NORTHEASTERN REGION OF ITURI (DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO) 
HAS INCREASINGLY WORSENED, INCLUDING A MILITARY OCCUPATION OF 
THE CITY OF BUNIA BY THE UGANDAN ARMED FORCES (UPDF) WHO HAVE 
CAUSED THE MILITIA OF THE MOVEMENT UNION DES PATRIOTES 
CONGOLAIS (UPC) TO FLEE.  THE GOVERNMENT OF KIGALI HAS 
PUBLISHED A DECLARATION THREATENING A REPOSITIONING OF 
RWANDAN TROOPS IN CONGO:  "IF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HAS 
FOUND IT ACCEPTABLE FOR UGANDA TO RETURN TO THE DRC, FOR ALL 
THE DUBIOUS REASONS IT HAS GIVEN, THEN IT IS LEGITIMATE THAT 
RWANDA SHOULD GO IN THE DRC TO CONTAIN THIS NEW SITUATION" 
(STATEMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND REGIONAL 
COOPERATION, MARCH 14TH, 2003). 
 
IN THIS REGARD, THE HOLY SEE EXPRESSES ITS CONCERN OVER THE 
FORESEEABLE CONSEQUENCES THAT SUCH A POSITION WILL HAVE ON 
THE STRAINED PEACE PROCESS IN THE REGION, AS WELL AS ON THE 
CIVIL POPULATION SUFFERING THE VIOLENCE OF THE VARIOUS ARMED 
GROUPS FIGHTING IN THAT REGION. 

FOR THESE REASONS, THE HOLY SEE ASKS THE INTERESTED PARTIES 
TO AVOID FURTHER SUFFERING OF UNARMED CIVILIANS, TO RESPECT 
THE AGREEMENT FOR THE CEASE-FIRE AND TO WITHDRAW FOREIGN 
TROOPS FROM CONGOLESE TERRITORY, TO RESUME NEGOTIATIONS FOR 
PEACE IN THE AREA AND TO PUT INTO PLACE A TRANSITIONAL 
GOVERNMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. 
 
THE SECRETARIAT OF STATE HAS ASKED THE APOSTOLIC NUNCIOS IN 
THE INTERESTED COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS THE PERMANENT OBSERVERS 
TO THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION IN NEW YORK AND GENEVA, TO 
PRESENT THESE CONCERNS TO THE HIGHEST LEVELS.  AT THE SAME 
TIME, IT APPEALS TO THOSE GOVERNMENTS WHICH MAINTAIN CLOSE 
RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN COUNTRIES OF THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION, URGING BOTH THEM AND THE MILITIA TO WORK MORE 
DECISIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY TOWARDS A LASTING PEACE. 
 
FROM THE VATICAN, 24 MARCH 2003.

¶3. (SBU) COMMENT:  BECAUSE THE HOLY SEE HAS CLERGY ON ALL 
SIDES OF THIS CONFLICT, THEY HAVE GENERALLY AVOIDED TAKING 
STANDS ON ANY SIDE OF THE CONFLICT.  THEIR DECISION TO ENGAGE 
AT THIS TIME WITH A NOTE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES AND OTHER 
GOVERNMENTS ENGAGED IN THE PEACE EFFORT REFLECTS THEIR FEAR 
THAT THE PROGRESS ATTAINED TO DATE IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
IS AT RISK OF FALLING APART.  IT ALSO RESPONDS TO A RECENT 
ADMONITION FROM THE POPE, WHO CAUTIONED IN A RECENT AUDIENCE 
THAT, IN THE FACE OF THE FOCUS ON IRAQ, THAT THE WORLD NOT 
NEGLECT THE MANY OTHER WARS AND CONFLICTS THAT THREATENED 
    HUMANITY.
