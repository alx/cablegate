Classified By: Charge d' Affaires Lisa Kubiske, reason: 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Brazil,s Ministry of External Relations 
(MRE) Head of Mexico and Central America Division First 
Secretary Renato de Avila Viana told Poloff on September 22 
at 14:00 EDT that, with power and water cut off and 70 
pro-Zelaya protesters now also trapped on the compound, the 
situation in Brazil,s embassy in Tegucigalpa is becoming 
dire.  (Note: Subsequent reports indicate that water and 
electricity have been restored.) Although they believe an 
invasion of the embassy by Honduran security forces is 
unlikely, MRE is concerned with the current vulnerability of 
their embassy and is hoping the USG can help supply its 
embassy and avoid violence.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) Though it took several calls over the last two days to 
get through to Viana, he now seemed eager to talk and was 
unusually candid during the conversation that, with the 
situation changing quickly, he is only concerned with 
contacting the USG on the issue. 
 
¶3. (C) The Charge spoke this afternoon with Brazilian 
presidency Foreign Policy Advisor Ambassador Marcel Biato to 
offer any coordination and assistance the GOB may need in 
dealing with the situation at their Embassy in Tegucigalpa. 
Biato thanked the Charge for the offer and indicated that the 
GOB was in touch with Washington and USG officials in New 
York on the issue. (Note: The top GOB leadership, including 
President Lula, Foreign Minister Amorim, and Presidential 
Foreign Policy Adviser Marco Aurelio Garcia, are currently in 
New York to attend UNGA, leaving MRE Deputy FM (Secretary 
General) Ambassador Samuel Guimaraes, Under Secretary for 
Latin America Enio Cordeiro, and Biato as the senior 
officials managing the issue in Brazil.  End note.)

SITUATION AT THE BRAZILIAN EMBASSY IN TEGUCIGALPA IS GRAVE 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶4. (C) Viana explained that water, electricity, and phone 
lines to the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa had been cut 
and the Embassy was running solely on a diesel generator that 
was running out of fuel. As of 05:00 this morning the 
Honduran police and military cleared the streets surrounding 
the Brazilian Embassy of protestors. Seventy pro-Zelaya 
Honduran protestors sought refuge in the Brazilian Embassy 
and remain there; Viana said that the protestors remain calm. 
Eight Brazilians from the Embassy were allowed to return 
home, leaving only the Charge and three other Brazilians at 
the Embassy. So far, the Honduran security forces have not 
intruded on the Brazilian Embassy, however Viana noted that 
the streets around the Embassy are full of security forces 
and it is clear that the Honduran strategy is to "asphyxiate 
the Embassy." The situation is grave, Viana explained, and 
the Brazilians in the Embassy and the MRE are concerned that 
the situation will escalate. Viana said that right now an 
invasion is improbable but not out of the realm of 
possibility.

GOB RESPONSE AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH THEIR EMBASSY 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5. (C) The MRE and GOB are maintaining constant contact with 
the Brazilian Charge in Honduras and Zelaya via cellular 
phones and the Brazilian Embassy is also in contact with the 
U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Viana reported. He recounted 
that Brazilian President Lula and Foreign Minister Amorim 
both called Zelaya this morning and requested that he contain 
his supporters and their protests to prevent confrontation 
with the Honduran security forces. He also said the Brazilian 
Ambassador in Washington had contacted the State Department 
this morning. 
 
-------------------- 
GOB REQUESTS US HELP 
-------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) According to Viana, the Brazilian Embassy in 
Tegucigalpa has asked the U.S. Embassy in Honduras for help 
in maintaining security at the Brazilian Embassy and for 
 
BRASILIA 00001184  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
diesel fuel to run their generator. Viana said they would be 
in need of food and water, but were concerned that no one 
would be able to reach them with fuel and other basics since 
the streets were controlled by the Honduran security forces. 
Viana lamented that the Brazilian Embassy did not have "the 
type of protection the U.S. Embassy has, the Marines," 
because they are unable to defend the Embassy. Viana 
reiterated the message that the MRE and Brazilian Embassy 
have already passed to the U.S. Embassy in Tegucigalpa and 
Washington, that the GOB is concerned with the vulnerability 
of their Embassy in Honduras and apprehensive of what may 
happen. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
COMMENT: TAKEN BY SURPRISE, GOB TURNS TO THE USG 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶7. (C) The openness and availability of MRE officials today 
their open concern that the situation is worsening, along 
with Brazil,s traditional reticence to take controversial 
positions or actions in the region, seem to confirm other 
reporting that that the Brazilians were taken by surprise by 
Zelaya and were unprepared to deal with the fallout.  They 
clearly fear that the situation may get desperate quickly, 
and see the United States as key to acquiring immediate help 
and international assistance. Post will continue to seek 
updates from MRE on the situation and GOB plans.
