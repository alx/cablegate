SUBJECT:  ICELAND:  ADDITIONAL IRAQ ASSISTANCE NOT

REF:  (A) STATE 44648, (B) REYKJAVIK 69 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post briefed Icelandic MFA Head of Security 
and Disarmament Division Thordur Bjarni Gudjonsson 
March 23 on the President's budget requests for Iraq 
(ref A).  Asked the current Icelandic thinking on 
additional assistance for Iraqi reconstruction, 
Gudjonsson referenced Reykjavik's recent donation to 
the NATO Training Mission-Iraq (ref B) and said nothing 
further was planned at present.  Referring to the U.S. 
decision announced this month to draw down Naval Air 
Station Keflavik (NASKEF) he added, "After the last 
blow we have use for all the spare cash we can find." 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  The Government of Iceland has long 
argued that the U.S. should view its contributions 
(e.g. of airlift, peacekeepers, and cash) to NATO 
operations as counterbalancing Icelandic unwillingness 
to contribute to the costs of its own defense, e.g. by 
contributing to the NASKEF budget.  We will be watching 
to see whether the Government now adopts a systematic 
policy of declining to participate in international 
endeavors on the grounds that the U.S. has undercut 
Iceland's ability to act generously.  In light of its 
bid to join the 2009-10 UN Security Council, we predict 
any reluctance to be an international player will be 
short-lived.  End comment.
