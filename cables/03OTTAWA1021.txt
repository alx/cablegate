REF: SECSTATE 83100 
 
¶1. Canada's International Development Agency (CIDA) confirmed 
April 9 that Canada has committed C$5.4 million to Kosovo for 
calendar year 2003.  (The Canadian dollar is worth about 68 
US cents.)  They do not, at this point, specifically support 
the Office of Returns and Communities, but will provide funds 
on an ad hoc basis when the security situation improves. 
Canada does, however, provide about C$1.1 million to a local 
initiative program managed from Pristina that can be used for 
ORC. 
 
¶2.  CIDA is consulting with UNMIK, but says nothing is 
happening on the ground.  Once it is feasible, Canada does 
intend to provide additional funds to support ORC.  Post 
believes CIDA would welcome any evidence Washington can 
provide that the time is ripe for effective use of 
contributions to ORC.
