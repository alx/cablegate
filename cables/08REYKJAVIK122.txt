SUBJECT: ICELAND RATIFIES IAEA CONVENTION ON NUCLEAR SAFETY 
 
¶1.  (U) Iceland's Ministry for Foreign Affairs announced via a press 
release on June 25 that Iceland has ratified the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Convention on Nuclear Safety.   Text of 
press release follows para. 2. 
 
¶2.  (U) Text of the MFA press release: 
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been presented 
with ratification documents for the Convention on Nuclear Safety. 
The ratification of the Convention will come into effect on 
Iceland's behalf on September 2. Iceland has now ratified all IAEA 
conventions in this area. 
 
The aim of the convention is to institute and maintain a high level 
of safety in land-based nuclear power plants around the world 
through subscribing to appropriate measures in individual countries 
and through international cooperation. The convention is also meant 
to prevent nuclear accidents and its ramifications. 
 
In spite of the fact that there are no nuclear power plants in 
Iceland, it is important to ensure that nuclear power plants in our 
neighboring states adhere to the most stringent conditions and 
standards. Membership in this convention allows Iceland to monitor 
the safety of nuclear power plants in those countries and 
participate in discussions on safety. 
 
By becoming a member of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, Iceland 
will have ratified all of IAEA's five conventions in this area. The 
other conventions are: a) The Convention on Early Notification of a 
Nuclear Accident (1986), b) The Convention on Physical Protection of 
Nuclear Material (1980), c) The Convention on Assistance in the Case 
of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency (1986), and d) The 
Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the 
Safety of Radioactive Waste Management (1997). 
 
The IAEA is a forum for international cooperation on nuclear issues 
that promotes the safe utilization of nuclear technology. Iceland's 
representative to the IAEA chairs the IAEA Radiation Standards 
Committee until 2010. In past years Iceland has made voluntary 
contributions to the IAEA Technology Fund. The IAEA makes regular 
requests for the participation of Icelandic experts to attend its 
meetings and give lectures.
