SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) A document prepared following a December luncheon in 
which private sector company representatives shared average 
monthly production numbers for both oil and gas production 
from their fields has given us a better idea of non-PDVSA oil 
production in Venezuela.  According to this document, 
December production by the private sector totaled 963,629 
b/d.  This figure is then broken down to show 503,000 b/d of 
production by the four extra heavy crude projects and 460,629 
b/d from the various Operating Agreements.  These numbers 
support the 1 million b/d figure that is generally cited as 
the assessment of private sector production.  Private sector 
production is ever more important as we believe it likely 
that PDVSA's own production will continue to decline slowly. 
This information may give us a basis on which to calculate 
the extent to which the private sector can ramp up production 
in 2004.  End Summary. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The difficulty of assessing Venezuelan oil 
production (besides misstatements about the extent of PDVSA's 
own production by GOV authorities) is increased by the number 
and complexity of the business structures under which the 
private sector, both foreign and domestic, operates.  There 
are currently 32 active "Operating Agreements" or 
"convenios," granted in three investment "rounds" in the 
1990's, under which a company provides financial resources, 
infrastructure, operational skills and technology and is paid 
by PDVSA on a fee-per-barrel-produced basis. 
 
¶3. (U) Under another structure, the so-called "Strategic 
Associations," four projects were developed to extract the 
extra heavy crude of the Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt and then 
convert it into synthetic crudes for the international 
market.  Hamaca, the joint venture between ConocoPhillips, 
ChevronTexaco and PDVSA, and the fourth and last of these 
projects, is already producing heavy crude.  Its upgrader is 
expected to come on line in the latter part of 2004. 
 
¶4. (U) This multiplicity of projects and fields has made it 
difficult to assess the actual production by private oil 
companies, which has become increasingly important as 
PDVSA,s own production is believed to be dropping.  (Note: 
This will become more complicated in 2005 when the first 
production is expected from a field developed under a "Risk 
Exploration Agreement" under which private companies took on 
exploration risks in assigned fields.  End Note)  The private 
sector has generally been credited with the production of 
approximately a million barrels of oil per day, with both the 
Strategic Associations and the convenios each  believed to be 
contributing about half.

AND THE NUMBER SEEMS TO BE... 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Econoff recently received a document prepared 
following a producers luncheon in December in which the 
company representatives present gave average monthly 
production numbers for both oil and gas production from their 
fields as well as a few operational notes.  That information, 
covering most but not all of the Operating Agreements, is 
reproduced in para. 8 below. 
 
¶6. (SBU) According to the document, December production by 
non-PDVSA producers was as follows: 
 
Operating Agreements Production: 
 
-- Eastern Venezuela  207,511 b/d 
-- Western Venezuela  253,118 b/d 
 
Total                 460,629 b/d 
 
Strategic Association Production: 
 
-- Cerro Negro        121,000 b/d 
-- Hamaca              82,000 b/d 
-- Petrozuata         120,000 b/d (est.) 
-- Sincor             180,000 b/d 
 
Total                 503,000 b/d 
 
GRAND TOTAL           963,629 b/d 
 
As noted above, all the Operating Agreements were not 
included in this document.  South Monagas, a Round One block 
operated by Benton-Vinccler, produces about 22,000 b/d. 
Falcon East and West are small Round Two blocks operated 
respectively by Vinccler and Samson.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Most industry analysts believe PDVSA's own 
production will continue to decline in 2004 unless a serious 
investment and work program is implemented.  In that case, 
private sector production is ever more important.  There are 
limits, however, to the extent to which it can be increased. 
For instance, on January 28 Joaquin Moreno, President of 
Shell de Venezuela, informed econoff that production at 
Shell's Urdaneta West field has increased to 54,000 b/d and 
is "on its way to 60,000."  When asked if production would be 
60,000 by year end, he responded that it would probably be 
only 55,000-56,000 b/d at the end of 2004 "because of the 
difficulties of the reservoir."  Urdaneta West produces a 
desirable crude and Shell has been requested by PDVSA to 
produce as much as it can.  Other fields produce less 
desirable crudes and their operators have received no such 
requests.  There are also technical constraints such as 
pipeline and terminal capacity.   Finally, the private sector 
production, and particularly that from the extra heavy crude 
projects, does not produce the same revenue stream for the 
GOV as PDVSA's own production.  In sum, the private sector is 
not likely to provide a magic bullet to stabilize Venezuela's 
production levels, at least in the short term.  We hope, 
however, to use this information as the basis on which to 
calculate the extent to which the private sector may be able 
to increase its production in 2004.  End Comment.

current 10,000 b/d because of delays in the completion of a 
gas injection project and asphaltine drop out in the wells.

re-pressurize.  Currently injecting an average of 78 mscf/d 
from 2 injectors.
