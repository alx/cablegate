RESOLUTION 

REF: STATE 15722 

EMBOFFS delivered reftel points to Mr. Peter van der Vliet, 
Deputy Director of the Dutch MFA's UN and International 
Financial Institutions Department. Van der Vliet advised 
that the Netherlands intends to abstain in the February 26 
vote in the UN General Assembly on the Palestinian-drafted 
resolution on the Goldstone Report. He said other EU member 
states who are like-minded on the issue will similarly 
abstain but noted that it looks like quite a number of EU 
members will vote in favor. While he said that things 
could change depending on the outcome of last-minute EU 
coordination efforts, the Netherlands will, in any case, 
not/not vote in favor of the resolution.
