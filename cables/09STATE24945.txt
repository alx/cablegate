¶1. (U) This is an urgent action request to Embassies Amman and Cairo. Please deliver as soon as possible. Please see paragraphs 4 and 5.

---------- 
Background
---------- 

¶2. (S/NF) We have received information that Iran intends to ship a cargo of lethal military equipment to Syria with onward transfer to Sudan. Our information indicates the equipment may then be transferred to Hamas. Per REFTELS, Iran has been attempting to transfer military equipment via Sudan for the past two months. We believe these current flights may begin in the very near future. Any arms export by Iran would be a violation of UNSCR 1747, regardless of the recipient.

---------- 
Objectives
---------- 

¶3. (S/NF) Posts should seek to:
-- Inform host governments that Iran intends to continue delivering lethal military equipment to
-- Inform the host government that additional flights are expected to depart in the very near future.
-- Ask host nation to require the flights to land for inspection or deny overflight.
-- Emphasize that UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1747, paragraph 5, states Iran shall not supply, sell or transfer directly or indirectly any arms of related materiel, whether or not originating in Iran.

-------------- 
Action Request
-------------- 

¶4. (S) Posts are requested to approach appropriate host government officials as soon as possible, using the points in para 5 to approach host governments to inform them of the flights and request their assistance to deny overflight or require the planes to land for inspection.

¶5. (SECRET/REL JORDAN and EGYPT) Begin Talking Points:
--We have recently received information that Iran intends to transship military equipment from Syria to Sudan, to be transferred to Hamas. We believe the flights will be conducted using cargo aircraft and will begin in the very near future.
--These flights will likely be conducted by . However, we cannot rule out that Iran may use other cargo planes and/or airlines.
-- UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1747, para. 5 states that Iran shall not supply, sell or transfer directly or indirectly any arms or related materiel, whether or not originating in Iran.
-- Any supply or transfer outside Iran of arms and related materiel violates Iran’s obligations under UNSCR 1747.
--We are passing this information to you in an effort to highlight a transfer of proliferation concern and to ensure that Iran does not make use of your territory to transfer items proscribed by UN Security Council resolutions 1737, 1747, and 1803.
--We request that your government look into these flights and either consider denying overflight permission or require the flights to land for inspection.
