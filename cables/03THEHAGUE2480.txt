SUBJECT: NEW DUTCH FOREIGN MINISTER DESIGNATED - BERNARD 
BEN BOT 


Classified By: Political Counselor Mary E. Daly reasons 1.5 (b & d) 

¶1. (C) Summary: On September 30, Prime Minister Jan Peter 
Balkenende asked retired career diplomat Bernard Bot to 
accept the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs beginning in 
early December, 2003. Bot declared himself most willing to 
accept the position. The intention is for de Hoop Scheffer 
to stay in office through the OSCE Ministerial December 1-2. 
The primary reason for choosing Bot is the need for an 
accomplished technocrat to run the Dutch EU presidency. Bot 
most recently served as the Netherlands' permanent 
representative at the EU between 1992 and 2002. Prior to 
that, he was Dutch ambassador to Turkey and to NATO, as well 
as Secretary General of the MFA. Privately, sources close to 
the Prime Minister told us that the Prime Minister insisted 
that foreign policy remain unchanged, especially regarding 
relations with the United States and Israel. Bot's interview 
with the Prime Minister this weekend was reportedly very long 
and designed to assess whether he was willing to carry out 
the current policy line. According to the PM's top political 
advisor, Balkenende was fully satisfied that Bot was strongly 
committed to the Atlantic partnership. The Prime Minister 
passed over candidates from the political class. While he 
would have liked CDA floor leader Maxime Verhagen in the job 
(the men are extremely close personally and on policy), he 
could not spare him from parliament. Bot's resume follows.
