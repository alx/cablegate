¶1. (SBU) On February 12, 2009, following communication with
the Naval Station Rota Legal Office, post was informed that
this case was with the Public Prosecutor's office awaiting his
decision on whether, or not, to pursue further action in this
case (reftels). The Public Prosecutor was also to determine
whether the case contained enough evidence to charge the police
officers. We have since been informed that the Public
Prosecutor has decided to close the case - no charges against
Mr. Kee, or the police officers will be filed. He, however,
noted that Mr. Kee could press charges against the police
officers if he wished to do so in the future. Post was also
informed that Mr. Kee will not have any criminal record in Spain.

¶2. (SBU) Comment: ODC is seeking to track Mr. Kee down and see
if he wishes to still pursue a case against the Guardia Urbana.
End comment.
