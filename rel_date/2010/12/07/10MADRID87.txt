//Bilateral Relations// 

¶5. (U) Spain is an important friend and ally of the U.S.  We 
especially value Spanish cooperation on security issues and 
in the fights against terrorism and narcotics.  It would be 
worth discussing increased cooperation against Latin American narcotics traffickers.  Spain is the principal point of entry for South American cocaine coming to Europe and has a serious domestic drug consumption problem.  Spain is also a strong bilateral defense partner, and operates a Provincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan with about 1,000 troops participating in ISAF.  Zapatero was criticized for his poor relations with the USG during the Bush Administration (a result of his Iraq pullout).  His enthusiasm for President Obama and his desire for closer bilateral relations have resulted in GOS willingness to send 511 more troops to Afghanistan, pending legislative approval, and to take 5 Guantanamo detainees.  In both cases, he has faced public criticism that he has subordinated Spain's interest to President Obama's.  Spain also allows us the use of two military bases, Rota and Moron, that are crucial transit  points between the U.S. and Afghanistan and Iraq. Counter-terrorism and law enforcement cooperation is strong, 
and business ties are increasing.
