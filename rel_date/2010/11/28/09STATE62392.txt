¶1. (S/NF) This cable provides the full text of the new 
National HUMINT Collection Directive (NHCD) on Bulgaria 
(paragraph 3-end) as well as a request for continued DOS 
reporting of biographic information relating to Bulgaria 
(paragraph 2). 
 
¶A. (S/NF) The NHCD below supercedes the NHCD contained in Ref 
C and reflects the results of a recent Washington review of 
reporting and collection needs focused on Bulgaria.  The NHCD 
sets forth a list of priorities (paragraph 3) and reporting 
and collection needs (paragraph 4) intended to guide 
participating USG agencies as they allocate resources and 
update plans to collect information on Bulgaria.  The 
priorities may also serve as a useful tool to help the 
Embassy manage reporting and collection, including 
formulation of Mission Strategic Plans (MSPs). 
 
¶B. (S/NF) This NHCD is compliant with the National 
Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), which was 
established in response to NSPD-26 of February 24, 2003.  If 
needed, GRPO can provide further background on the NIPF and 
the use of NIPF abbreviations (shown in parentheses following 
each sub-issue below) in NHCDs. 
 
¶C. (S/NF) Important information responsive to the NHCD often 
is available to non-State members of the Country Team whose 
agencies participated in the review leading the the NHCD,s 
issuance. COMs, DCMs, and State reporting officers can assist 
by coordinating with other Country Team members to encourage 
relevant reporting through their own or State Department 
channels. 
 
¶2. (S/NF) State biographic reporting ) including on 
Bulgarians: 
 
¶A. (S/NF) The intelligence community relies on State 
reporting officers for much of the biographical information 
collected worldwide.  Informal biographic reporting via email 
and other means is vital to the community's collection 
efforts and can be sent to the INR/B (Biographic) office for 
dissemination to the IC.  State reporting officers are 
encouraged to report on noteworthy Palestinians as 
information becomes available. 
 
¶B. (S/NF) Reporting officers should include as much of the 
following information as possible when they have information 
relating to persons linked to Bulgaria: office and 
organizational titles; names, position titles and other
