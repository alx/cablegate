POLITICAL FUTURE 

REF: PARIS 186 

Classified By: POLITICAL MINISTER COUNSELOR JOSIAH ROSENBLATT FOR REASO 
NS 1.4 (B) AND (D) 

¶1. (S) SUMMARY: France,s chief counterterrorism judge, 
Jean-Louis Bruguiere, told us on January 19 that a recent 
surge in overall GSPC activities worried French 
counterterrorism officials, who are convinced there is now a 
significantly higher threat against France and its interests 
abroad. Tunisian security services, he said, had essentially 
shut the French out, preferring to deny the existence of a 
threat. Morocco was cooperative, while Algeria remained hot 
and cold, or "as usual." 

¶2. (S) Summary continued: Operational relations between 
France and the U.S. were excellent, Bruguiere said. He also 
praised DNI John Negroponte,s comments on Pakistan, adding 
that President Musharraf did not exercise control over all of 
Pakistan and that this country posed the most immediate 
threat to global security. He confirmed that he had 
conferred with GoF officials, including President Chirac, on 
the timing and fallout of his issuance of arrest warrants 
against top Kigame aides and warned against better U.S. 
relations with Rwanda. Bruguiere also confirmed rumors that 
he will likely be leaving the top terrorism court to pursue 
political ambitions. END SUMMARY 

GSPC THREAT AND THE MAGHREB 
--------------------------- 

¶3. (S) France,s chief counterterrorism judge, Jean-Louis 
Bruguiere, told us on January 19 that he found an apparent 
escalation in GSPC activities in the Maghreb during the past 
several months particularly worrisome. France, he said, was 
at a higher state of alert and would likely remain so for the 
foreseeable future. While there was no specific threat 
information, he said the GoF was convinced that cells and 
supporters were prepared to be active in France and Europe. 
The dismantling of at least two, relatively major, Islamic 
cells on French territory every year showed a clear and 
present threat. Information exchange with Tunisia, he said, 
was now virtually non-existent. The Tunisian government was 
either in denial or did not know how to proceed and was 
shutting out the French. Morocco continues to be relatively 
reliable with information, with Algeria as, "as usual," 
excellent on some days and like Tunisia on others. (COMMENT: 
Bruguiere,s characterization of operational cooperation with 
the Maghreb is worse than other C/T contacts have previously 
reported. Bruguiere,s observations, therefore, may or may 
not apply to all of the French intelligence services. End 
Comment) 

U.S./FRANCE COOPERATION 
----------------------- 

¶4. (S) Bruguiere commented that U.S./France judicial and 
operational exchanges remained excellent. He said that while 
France,s legal system gave him much more discretion than the 
U.S. system, our ability to work together was not hindered by 
this; we had to be creative. (Note: Bruguiere was an expert 
witness in the successful prosecution of Ahmed Ressam in the 
famed L.A. trial, the U.S. vs. Ahmed Ressam). 

PAKISTAN 
-------- 

¶5. (S) The judge praised DNI John Negroponte,s comments on 
Pakistan during a recent Congressional intelligence briefing. 
He said he was convinced that Pakistan posed the single 
greatest threat to global security. President Musharaf, he 
noted, lacked real control over both the territory of the 
country and security and military agencies. Rogue elements 
from Pakistan, he insisted, were the most likely to provide 
nuclear weapons and safe-haven to terrorists. 

RWANDA 
------ 

¶6. (S) Bruguiere confirmed that he had consulted within the 
GoF on his issuance of arrest warrants in the cases brought 

PARIS 00000322 002 OF 002 


against nine of President Kagame,s top aides for 
assassination of President Habyarimana and three French 
aircraft crew (see reftel A). He said he presented his 
decision to French officials, including President Chirac, as 
his independent judicial right, but chose to consult with 
them because he was convinced of the need to coordinate 
timing with the government. Bruguiere said he was not 
surprised by Rwanda,s official reaction, and said that the 
GoF had prepared for what it thought would be a violent 
response against French nationals. He praised his own 
decision to move forward, adding that the international 
community had a certain moral responsibility, and that his 
actions were in the pursuit of justice. Bruguiere was 
satisfied that the nine individuals he listed could not leave 
Rwanda without fear of arrest, but was doubtful the ICTR 
would take up the case. (COMMENT: Bruguiere,s presented his 
case in a very professional manner, but he did not hide his 
personal desire to see Kagame,s government isolated. He 
warned that closer U.S. ties with Rwanda would be a mistake. 
END COMMENT) 

BRUGUIERE MOVING ON? 
-------------------- 

¶7. (C) Since 1982 Bruguiere has been one of the leading 
players in the French fight against terrorism, and he is 
considered a leading world expert in terrorism. He has been 
the chief of the French counterterrorism court, created in 
1986, since its inception. He has survived at least one 
direct assassination attempt, and is the most visible 
counterterrorism figure in France. Bruguiere,s ambitions 
have now turned to the political, however. He told us that 
he is likely to run for a parliamentary seat later this year. 
Bruguiere also casually mentioned that a cabinet post 
(Minister of Justice) would be his first choice. His 
departure will be a loss to the court, but it has become a 
solid institution under his tutelage and it,s clear that 
Bruguiere intends to stay an active part of the C/T community.
