1.4 b and d. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  PolCouns delivered the demarche on September 24 to 
Minister Marcos Pinta Gama in the Foreign Ministry's General 
Secretariat of Foreign Relations, and Poloff delivered it on 
September 29 to First Secretary Marisa Kenicke, the 
Afghanistan desk officer.  Pinta Gama noted that Brazil had 
attended an earlier donor conference on Afghanistan and was 
considering ways in which it might be helpful.  Up to this 
point, Brazil has looked for development-related projects 
rather than support for the military, however.  So far, the 
GOB has not found feasible opportunities for supporting 
Afghanistan.  Kenicke received the demarche without 
substantive comment and reported October 1 that there was 
still no official response. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Brazil's track record suggests that it would be 
precedent-breaking for Brazil to support a foreign military 
force outside of a UN system mechanism, within which the GOB 
strongly prefers to work.  The request of five million 
dollars over five years is far larger than many other 
requests we have made which have gone unanswered.  Brazil's 
resources for assistance in general are extremely limited, 
and the GOB tends to prefer technical assistance for social 
development projects.
