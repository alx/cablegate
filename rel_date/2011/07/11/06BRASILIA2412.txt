SUBJECT: BRAZIL: AMBASSADOR'S SECOND MEETING WITH 
PRESIDENTIAL CHIEF OF STAFF 
 
Classified By: ACTING DEPUTY CHIEF OF MISSION DENNIS HEARNE. REASONS: 1 
.4 (B)(D). 
 
¶1. (C) Summary. Ambassador and A/DCM met on 13 November with 
Gilberto Carvalho, President Lula da Silva's chief of 
personal staff.  It was their second substantive meeting in 
the space of a week, and the hour-long discussion focused 
primarily on a agenda topics and modalities for a possible 
visit by Lula to the United States for a meeting with 
President Bush (at his invitation), bilateral relations and 
Venezuela.  Carvalho also indicated plans are not yet 
finalized for Lula's re-inauguration on 1 January 2007, but 
that thought is being given to a small-scale event, with 
foreign governments represented by ambassadors, not 
international delegates.  End summary. 
 
Presidential Meeting 
 
¶2. (C) Carvalho said Lula is eager for the meeting with 
President Bush, and would welcome an informal, non-Washington 
venue befitting the warm relationship between the presidents. 
 Carvalho and Ambassador then discussed possible agenda items 
for a Lula-Bush meeting.  Focus points could be:  (1) 
bio-fuels; (2) debt relief in developing countries (IDB 
President Moreno mentioned this to Ambassador recently and it 
is an area of interest for Lula; (2) Brazil-US 
security/intelligence exchange; (3) Cuba - U.S.-Brazil 
cooperation to facilitate a post-Fidel "soft landing;" (4) 
trade - moving toward a practical/effective dialogue in 
Lula's second term; (4) climate.  Ambassador and Carvalho 
agreed that these would be preliminary ideas, and that the 
agenda could be adjusted and developed.  Carvalho seemed 
enthused about the agenda items and indicated he would share 
them with Lula at once, giving us feedback asap. 
 
Bilateral Relations 
 
¶3. (C) Carvalho again made it clear he wants to serve as a 
direct channel for the Ambassador to Lula, and indicated he 
would facilitate face-to-face meetings when there is a need. 
Carvalho did ask the Ambassador to assure he also remains 
attentive to his formal relationship with the foreign 
ministry (MRE), "which can be jealous of its  equities." 
Ambassador assured Carvalho of his sensitivity on this point, 
and explained he would be flying to Rio later in the week 
especially to meet with Foreign Minister Amorim for further 
discussion of the presidents' meeting plans (septel to 
follow).  Carvalho also underscored again that the second 
Lula mandate will see a closer approximation to the U.S., 
including on the trade front.  Carvalho -- who has been 
Lula's confidante and advisor for more than 30 years -- 
explained that Lula's first term had been a balancing act 
between maintaining credibility with the conservative market 
and keeping the far left of Lula's base content by assuring 
them Lula, as president, was not surrendering their 
traditional banners.  In the second term, Lula is better 
positioned to take issues on pragmatically, including trade, 
Carvalho said.  Ambassador noted Lula may be practical but 
there remain people in the GOB who seem ideologically driven, 
and who make statements that can confuse Washington about 
Brazil's policy direction.  Ambassador did not name names, 
but his comments clearly were directed at MRE Secretary 
General Pinheiro Guimaraes, a famous anti-U.S. ideologue, who 
at a conference a few days ago said publicly it is not 
impossible that Brazil might someday leave the Nuclear 
Non-proliferation Treaty.  Carvalho was openly dismissive of 
Guimaraes' remarks and reiterated that the GOB is focused on 
working with us. 
 
Venezuela 
 
¶4. (C) Ambassador noted Lula's travel to Venezuela on 14 
November, and reviewed Chavez's irresponsible rhetoric, his 
arms acquisitions, and other provocations.  Ambassador

stressed that the USG sees Brazil as a crucial counterbalance 
in the region to Chavez's unpredictable and troubling 
behavior.  Carvalho said the GOB also has "difficult" 
relations with Chavez and Bolivia's Evo Morales, but has 
attempted to maintain a balanced approach in which Brazil can 
ameliorate their behaviors through dialogue.  Ambassador 
reiterated that the USG hopes more engagement by Brazil will 
serve to counterbalance Chavez' pernicious influence. 
 
Inauguration 
 
¶5. (C)  Carvalho confided that planning for Lula's January 
inaugural remains fluid, but that it appears Lula will have 
to take office on 1 January, because of constitutional 
issues.  Hence the GOB is considering a low-key event, with 
foreign governments represented by their ambassadors instead 
of international delegations.  He undertook to keep 
Ambassador posted on the developing planning.
