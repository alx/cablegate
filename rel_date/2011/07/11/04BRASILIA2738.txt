SUBJECT: AVIATION SECURITY:  DIALOGUE BETWEEN USG AND 
BRAZIL ON SUPPLYING PASSENGER NAME RECORD DATA 
 
 
Classified By: DCM Phillip Chicola Based upon Reason 1.4(B) and (D) 
 
¶1.  (C)   Based upon ongoing discussions between AmEmbassy 
Brasilia DHS Attache and officials at the GOB Civil Aviation 
Authority (DAC), post requests that Department approach DHS 
to suggest that the US and the GOB commence talks on the how 
Brazilian carriers supply the USG with Passenger Name Record 
Data for flights destined to the U.S.  While previously, 
citing legal restrictions, Varig (Brazil's principal overseas 
carrier) had declined to supply the USG with such data, 
consultations recently undertaken have indicated that there 
is now a greater willingness on the Brazilian side to find a 
way to provide the needed information. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Whatever understanding is reached, it will likely 
need to be memorialized in a written agreement between DHS 
and the DAC.  We think it advisable that Department formally 
contact DHS's Customs and Border Protection officials asap to 
suggest that it initiate such talks.  If necessary, post 
would welcome the travel of an interagency USG team to Brazil 
to discuss the issue with the DAC.  Embassy Point of Contact 
on this issue is Econ Counselor Bruce Williamson.
