¶1. (C) We read with deep concern ref a and b assessments of 
the deteriorating security situation and endangered political 
process in Haiti.  In light of these trends, we believe it is 
urgent that we engage directly at senior levels with the GOB, 
to gather information regarding their current assessment of 
MINUSTAH and potential replacement of its Brazilian 
commander, and also to seek common approaches to dealing with 
a total collapse in civil order and any attempts by Aristide 
to return or subvert the elections.  We have a meeting 
scheduled for Ambassador Danilovich on 8 June with President 
Lula da Silva's international affairs advisor, Marco Aurelio 
Garcia, who has traveled to Haiti as the president's envoy 
and who has adopted a tough line against Aristide that we 
want to reinforce.    We may also seek an appointment with 
Ambassador Jose Felicio, the Foreign Ministry's lead official 
on Haiti, if Felicio does not travel next week to Haiti to 
meet with A/S Noreiga. 
 
¶2. (C) To prepare for these and follow-up engagements with 
the GOB on Haiti, we would appreciate guidance and talking 
points from Department at the earliest opportunity on the 
critical issues and views we should register with the 
Brazilians.  In particular, we would welcome points to share 
with the GOB on responding to South African President Mbeki 
in the event he seeks out President Lula to discuss Aristide. 
 
¶3. (U) Please advise.
