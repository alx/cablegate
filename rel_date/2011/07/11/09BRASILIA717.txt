¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: On May 29, Brazil launched a research rocket from 
the Alcantara Launch Center (CLA) in the northeastern state of 
Maranhao.  Brazilian officials are considering the launch a success 
for the Brazilian space program, and an important step toward 
putting a satellite into orbit.  Brazil plans to launch three more 
rockets in 2009, with the hopes that in 2010 it will become the 
first Latin American country to put a satellite into space.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On May 29, 2009 Brazil launched a 19 ft. long Orion rocket 
from its Alcantara Launch Center (CLA) in the northeastern state of 
Maranhao under the mission name "Maracati 1."  The Brazilian Space 
Agency reports that the rocket traveled 93km (57.8 miles) into the 
atmosphere before falling back into the ocean.  Both the Brazilian 
Space Agency and the military are calling the launch a "total 
success."  The rocket was equipped with tracking equipment to gather 
data during the flight for use in future launches. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Brazil plans to launch three more rockets from CLA in 
2009: one in July, one in September and one in November.  One of 
these launches will send a Brazilian sounding rocket (VSB-30) 200km 
above earth's surface to gather further flight data.  These launches 
will be completed in preparation for a July 2010 launch in which 
Brazil hopes to put a satellite into orbit aboard a Cyclone 4 
rocket.  If successful, the 2010 launch will mark the first time a 
Latin American country has accomplished this technical feat. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The May 29 launch comes after a two year hiatus.  The last 
launch at CLA was in July 2007 using a sounding rocket.  Even though 
key components of the rocket were never recovered, Brazil considered 
the launch a success.  Since its inception in 1994, the Brazilian 
Space Agency has attempted several times to launch a satellite into 
space, but has yet to succeed.  Brazil tried to launch a satellite 
on two occasions, one in 1997 and another 1999, but both rockets 
exploded shortly after take-off.  In 2003, Brazil attempted to send 
two satellites into space using one launch vehicle, but an explosion 
caused by a premature ignition of the rocket killed 21 people, and 
destroyed the launch pad. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The facility at Alcantara is the world's closest launch 
facility to the equator.  This unique feature allows engineers to 
reduce fuel consumption by using the earth's centripetal force to 
aid in the rocket's assent.  Although the Brazilian Space Agency 
uses the Alcantara facilities for launch research, the site is 
operated by the Brazilian Air Force. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) These launches are made possible through the extensive 
assistance provided by the Ukrainians via the Ukrainian-Brazilian 
joint venture Alcantara Cyclone Space, which was created in 2002. 
The Ukrainians had the responsibility for reconstructing the damaged 
launch facility, including the launch pad, while the Brazilians 
provided and improved the transportation infrastructure to the 
launch site.
