Brazil Launches High-Energy Effort on Haiti 
 
¶1.  (U) In the wake of the January 12 earthquake in Haiti, the GOB 
has taken an unusually active role in assistance efforts, building 
on its leadership of MINUSTAH and recent rotation onto the UN 
Security Council.  Brazilian actions to date include: 
 
*         Sent by President Lula, Defense Minister Nelson Jobim 
made a January 13-14 visit to Haiti to assess needs.  According to 
press reports, Jobim has defined Brazil's priorities as 1) burial 
of the dead; 2) medical assistance to the injured; 3) removal of 
debris; 4) reinforcement of security; and 5) distribution of 
supplies, principally water and food. 
 
*         The GOB has created a "crisis cabinet"under the direction 
of the Institutional Security Office (GSI) in the presidency to 
coordinate Brazil's humanitarian assistance. 
 
*         The GOB has made a commitment of USD 15 million to Haiti 
relief, the largest single assistance commitment Brazil has ever 
made. 
 
*         The GOB is sending of two planes with 14 tons each of 
foodstuffs, with an additional eight aircraft on standby for an 
"air bridge" to ferry additional supplies to Haiti as needed. 
 
*         The GOB sent January 14 two fire and rescue teams (one 
from Brasilia, one from Rio de Janeiro). 
 
*         The Brazilian military has established a field hospital 
in Port au Prince and will send two fully equipped field hospitals, 
one air force (already in process) and one naval (in the near 
future). 
 
*         The GOB has committed to sending an amphibious ship to 
arrive in Haiti in February. 
 
Brazilian Interest in Haiti Relief Opens New Avenue for Bilateral 
Cooperation 
 
¶2. (SBU) The disaster has further energized Brazilian interest in 
partnering with the USG in Haiti in both the near and long term. 
President Lula is advocating a donors conference as soon as 
possible, and spoke with President Obama about it on January 13. 
Foreign Ministry officials have made clear their interest in 
cooperating with the USG on both immediate disaster relief and 
longer term recovery assistance.  Brazilian Cooperation Agency 
(ABC) officials, who recently participated in a joint USAID-ABC 
visit to Haiti aimed at defining areas for joint work there 
(reftel), are particularly interested in working with us to define 
where assistance can best be used.  The Brazilian military reached 
out immediately after the quake to SOUTHCOM and is making every 
effort to coordinate its activities with the U.S. military. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment:  It is clear that Haiti remains a priority for 
the GOB and one in which it believes it can partner successfully 
with the United States, providing an opportunity for further 
expanding USG cooperation with the Brazilian military and ABC, and 
for demonstrating the potential of such partnerships to senior 
foreign ministry and presidency officials.  End comment. 
 
Brazilian Press Coverage of U.S. Efforts Extensive and Favorable 
 
¶4. (U) Brazilian broadcast, print and online media have all 
reported extensively on the U.S. commitment to Haiti.  Media 
reported on statements made by President Obama, Secretary Clinton, 
releases by USAID/OFDA and SouthCom, the mobilization of U.S. 
rescue teams, and the deployment of aircraft carrier USS Vinson to 
Haiti.  Television coverage by major stations, particularly TV 
Globo, regularly features footage of President Obama, Secretary 
Clinton, and U.S. relief efforts.  Media reported President Lula 
spoke by phone with President Obama about how to provide assistance 
through the United Nations, and the possibility of co-hosting a 
donor's conference as soon as possible.  An editorial in Brazil's 
largest newspaper, "Folha de Sao Paulo," entitled "Tragedy and 
Example," said that only more joint initiatives may help to ease 
the despair caused by the earthquake in Haiti.  Media noted 
President Obama's rapid response to the disaster.

Status of Brazilians in Haiti 
 
¶5.  (U) The Foreign Ministry established a 24-hour hotline for 
those seeking information on family members in Haiti.  The Foreign 
Ministry estimates over 1,300 Brazilians are resident in Haiti; 
Brazil's MINUSTAH contingent, consisting of 1,266 soldiers, is the 
largest segment.  The GOB has confirmed 14 deaths among the 
Brazilian contingent, and expects additional deaths.  It is already 
reportedly the largest loss for the Brazilian military in a single 
incident since 1945.  MINUSTAH Deputy Special Representative Luiz 
Carlos da Costa is missing and presumed dead.  One civilian death, 
that of prominent NGO head Zilda Arns, has also been confirmed. 
The wife of deputy foreign minister and former ambassador to the 
United States Antonio Patriota, stationed in Port au Prince with 
the UN, has been confirmed safe.
