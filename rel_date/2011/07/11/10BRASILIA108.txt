¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  In accordance with the Copenhagen Accord, the 
Government of Brazil (GOB) on January 29 notified the Executive 
Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 
of Brazil's nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs). 
These NAMAs were released prior to the UNFCCC Conference of the 
Parties (COP-15) (reftel) and also officially presented at COP-15 
by the Head of the Brazilian delegation, Minister Dilma Rousseff. 
In total, the NAMAs are intended to lead to a 36.1 percent to 38.9 
percent reduction in Brazil's emissions by 2020 compared with 
"business as usual."  An accompanying press release from the 
Ministry of External Relations indicates that the GOB is notifying 
the UNFCCC of its NAMAs per the Copenhagen Accord.  While the 
notification letter to the UNFCCC does not explicitly link the 
notification to the Accord, Brazil is demonstrably complying with 
it, albeit without using the label "associating."  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (U) On January 29, the Government of Brazil (GOB) sent a letter 
to Mr. Yvo de Boer, the Executive Secretary of the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), that listed the Nationally 
Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) Brazil intends to take.  The 
Ministry of External Relations (MRE) sought to put that letter in 
perspective with the following press release, which it posted on 
its website simultaneously with the letter to the UNFCCC. 
 
 
 
BEGIN TEXT OF PRESS RELEASE 
 
 
 
The 15th Conference of the Parties (COP-15) of the UN Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCC) took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 
December 2009.  There, a group of countries negotiated a political 
document entitled the Copenhagen Accord.  Although the Accord did 
not constitute an ideal solution, it offered elements for future 
discussion in the negotiations of a Climate Change Convention. 
 
 
 
The Accord was not adopted by the Conference of the Parties, which 
limited itself to taking note of its existence.  The document 
establishes that, by January 31, 2010, the countries that are 
Parties to Annex I (developed countries) should register their 
emissions reductions target for 2020 and the countries that are not 
Parties to Annex I (developing countries), such as Brazil, should 
inform [the UNFCCC] of the national emissions reduction actions 
that they intend to take. 
 
 
 
In the spirit of transparency and international cooperation, Brazil 
informed the UNFCCC Secretariat today, January 29, 2010, of the 
nationally appropriate mitigation actions that the Brazilian 
Government intends to implement.  These actions were early 
announced by the Head of the Brazilian delegation to COP-15, 
Minister Dilma Rousseff.

¶3.  (U) BEGIN TEXT OF JANUARY 29 LETTER TO UNFCCC 
 
 
 
Dear Mr. De Boer, 
 
 
 
Having regard to the announcement made by His Excellency President 
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva during the High Level Segment of the 15th 
Conference of the Parties (COP 15) and the 5th Conference of the 
Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol 
 
BRASILIA 00000108  002 OF 003 
 
 
(CMP 5) held at Copenhagen, the Government of Brazil would like to 
indicate the nationally appropriate mitigation actions that Brazil 
intends to take, for information of Parties to the UNFCCC. 
 
 
 
Please note that the envisaged domestic actions as indicated are 
voluntary in nature and will be implemented in accordance with the 
principles and provisions of the UNFCCC, particularly Article 4 
paragraph 1, Article 4 paragraph 7, Article 12 paragraph 1(b), 
Article 12 paragraph 4 and Article 10 paragraph 2(a).  The use of 
the Clean Development Mechanism established under the Kyoto 
Protocol is not excluded. 
 
 
 
- Reduction in Amazon deforestation (range of estimated reduction: 
564 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020); 
 
 
 
- Reduction in "Cerrado" deforestation (range of estimated 
reduction: 104 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020); 
 
 
 
- Restoration of grazing land (range of estimated reduction: 83 to 
104 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020); 
 
 
 
- Integrated crop-livestock system (range of estimated reduction: 
18 to 22 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020); 
 
 
 
- No-till farming (range of estimated reduction: 16 to 20 million 
tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020); 
 
 
 
- Biological N2 fixation (range of estimated reduction: 16 to 20 
million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020); 
 
 
 
- Energy efficiency (range of estimated reduction: 12 to 15 million 
tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020); 
 
 
 
- Increase the use of biofuels (range of estimated reduction: 48 to 
60 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020); 
 
 
 
- Increase in energy supply by hydroelectric power plants (range of 
estimated reduction: 79 to 99 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 
2020); 
 
 
 
- Alternative energy sources (range of estimated reduction: 26 to 
33 million tons of CO2 equivalent in 2020); 
 
 
 
- Iron & steel (replace coal from deforestation with coal from 
planted forests (range of estimated reduction: 8 to 10 million tons 
of CO2 equivalent in 2020); 
 
 
 
It is anticipated that these actions will lead to an expected 
reduction of 36.1% to 38.9% regarding the projected emissions of 
Brazil by 2020. 
 
 
 
The Brazilian Government took an active part in the negotiation of 
the Copenhagen Accord and understands it as an important step in 
order to facilitate the conclusion of the on-going two-track 
negotiations under the AWG-KP and the AWG-LCA with a view to adopt 
a decision on the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol 
 
BRASILIA 00000108  003 OF 003 
 
 
and also on the fulfillment of the Bali Action Plan during COP-16 
and CMP-6 in Mexico.

¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT.  The GOB did timely notify the UNFCCC of its 
NAMA in accordance with the Copenhagen Accord.  Further, the MRE's 
press release makes clear that the GOB was doing so to honor the 
commitment it made as one of the negotiators of the Copenhagen 
Accord.  However, the letter to the UNFCCC does not link the 
notification of Brazil's NAMAs to the Copenhagen Accord nor does it 
include a statement that Brazil "associates" itself with the 
Accord.   Still, Brazil is fully complying with the Accord, albeit 
without using the label "associating."  END COMMENT.
