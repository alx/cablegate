SUBJECT: Rio Radar - September 18, 2009 
 
¶1. Rio Radar is a weekly compilation of key economic, political, 
commercial, and other developments in the states of Rio de Janeiro, 
Bahia, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, and Sergipe.  This week's 
subjects: 
 
RIO MAYOR WANTS FURTHER COOPERATION WITH USG 
¶2. (U) On September 11, Principal Officer met with Rio de Janeiro 
Mayor Eduardo Paes.  The mayor, who has an Ambassador-level diplomat 
seconded from the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his 
International Relations staff, expressed interest in working with 
Post on a range of initiatives.  "I do not need financial 
assistance," he said, "I am looking to work with the United States 
through institutional partnerships and collaboration."  Paes and PO 
agreed to work together to develop a joint list for such 
initiatives. 
TSA FINDS NO PROBLEMS AT RIO'S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 
¶3. (U) A team from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
visited Rio de Janeiro's Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport 
(GIG) from September 14-18 to exchange technical information with 
officials from the Brazilian National Civil Aviation Authority 
(ANAC) and Brazilian airport operator INFRAERO related to ICAO 
standards, as well as evaluate passenger and cargo commercial 
aircraft operations that have direct flight services to the U.S. 
According to the Buenos Aires-based TSA regional representative, who 
also participated in the visit, all evaluations and meetings were 
successful.  "We were very impressed and pleased by everything ANAC 
and INFRAERO have done on security," he explained. 
ARMY GENERAL SUGGESTS ARMY SOLDIERS HELP PACIFY FAVELAS 
 
¶4. (U) During a September 18 seminar hosted by Brazilian development 
bank BNDES entitled "Opportunities for Favelas," Brazilian Army 
General Alvaro de Souza Pinheiro (retired) stated the Brazilian Army 
was prepared to cooperate with Rio de Janeiro state and municipal 
officials and police to occupy and maintain control of favelas 
(Note: Rio de Janeiro state currently maintains special police units 
-UPP - that are controlling five favelas.  End Note).  Citing the 
Brazilian army's role in United Nations Peacekeeping operations in 
Haiti, he said many officers and units were specifically trained and 
prepared to undertake operations related to public security and 
general policing in communities lacking state control. 
CONTROVERSIAL FAVELA WALL NEARS COMPLETION 
¶5. (U) The construction of a concrete wall around the Rio favela 
Santa Marta is 90 percent concluded and scheduled to be completed by 
the end of October 2009, according to the director of the Rio de 
Janeiro state Public Constructions Company (EMOP).  While proponents 
of the construction argue the wall is needed to thwart expansion of 
the favela into the surrounding rain forest, critics decry the 
initiative as unconstitutional.   A community leader from Santa 
Marta, Jos Mario dos Santos, told us on September 18 that his 
community was totally against the construction of the wall and 
considered it an act of discrimination by Rio State.  Rosino de 
Castro Diniz, president of the Federation of Rio de Janeiro Favela 
Associations also criticized the project, stating, "Favela residents 
need basic services from the government, not walls." 
 
PETROBRAS TO BUILD A PRE-SALT INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH CENTER 
¶6. (U) Petrobras is investing 10 million USD to build an 
international research center dedicated to pre-salt oil reserve 
development.  Petrobras and Schlumberger signed an agreement on 
September 10 to jointly develop the center, which will be built in a 
technological park situated on the Rio de Janeiro Federal University 
(UFRJ) campus. 
 
RIO DE JANEIRO PORT REVITALIZATION 
¶7. (U) During a September 14-15 seminar entitled "Rio de Janeiro 
Port Revitalization," participants stressed relations between the 
Rio de Janeiro state and municipal governments, as well as with the 
federal government, was the principal factor to successfully develop 
the port of Rio de Janeiro.  Municipal Secretary for Development 
Felipe Goes said the current political environment offered a "magic 
moment" that could facilitate port revitalization, thanks to 
unprecedented strong ties between the Rio and Brasilia.  The 
project, to occur in two phases, has an estimated budget of 3.2 
billion Brazilian Reals (1.7 million USD).
