SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR DISCUSSES IRAQ WITH PRESIDENT HALONEN 
 
REF: HELSINKI 248 
 
CLASSIFIED BY: POL CHIEF JOHN HALL, REASONS 1.5(B) AND (D) 
 
¶1. (C) ON MARCH 4 THE AMBASSADOR CALLED ON PRESIDENT HALONEN 
FOR A GENERAL DISCUSSION OF ISSUES ON THE INTERNATIONAL AND 
BILATERAL AGENDA.  IRAQ WAS THE CHIEF TOPIC.  THE AMBASSADOR 
BEGAN BY THANKING THE PRESIDENT FOR HER RECENT FIRM PUBLIC 
STATEMENTS THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR RESOLVING THE CRISIS 
                       CONFIDENTIAL

LIES WITH SADDAM, NOT WITH THE UN, THE U.S., OR OTHERS. 
 
¶2. (C) THE PRESIDENT REITERATED HER BELIEF THAT IRAQI 
COMPLIANCE WITH UNSC RESOLUTIONS IS THE KEY TO THE PROBLEM. 
AT THE SAME TIME, SHE STRESSED THAT THE MAJORITY OF FINNS 
OPPOSE DISARMING SADDAM BY FORCE.  AN ANTI-WAR PETITION 
SIGNED BY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD BEEN DELIVERED TO THE 
PRESIDENTIAL PALACE DURING THE DAY-LONG DEMONSTRATIONS 
FEBRUARY 15.  THE AMBASSADOR CONGRATULATED FINLAND ON BEING A 
COUNTRY THAT WELCOMES DISSENT -- AND CONGRATULATED THE FINNS 
ON THEIR ABILITY TO DISSENT IN AN ORDERLY WAY.  THE PRESIDENT 
LAUGHED, "YES, WE FINNS ARE ORDERLY." 
 
¶3. (C) HALONEN ALSO VOICED FINNISH CONCERN ABOUT THE 
AFTERMATH OF A CONFLICT, ESPECIALLY ITS EFFECT ON THE 
DEVELOPING NATIONS OF THE REGION.  IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY REACH OUT TO NATIONS WHERE POVERTY IS 
RAMPANT -- WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO MAKE CONNECTIONS.  THE 
PRESIDENT ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THE 
POLITICAL STRUCTURES OF NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, EMPHASIZING 
THAT SHE WAS NOT WORRIED ABOUT IRAN.  (SHE SEEMED TO BE 
REFERRING IN PARTICULAR TO SAUDI ARABIA.)  THE AMBASSADOR 
SAID THE UNITED STATES IS EQUALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ECONOMIC 
AND POLITICAL STABILITY, BOTH WITHIN IRAQ AND IN THE REGION, 
AND WAS COMMITTED TO A VISION OF A FUTURE OF HOPE FOR ALL OF 
THE MIDDLE EAST.  IN THIS CONNECTION, WE APPRECIATE FINLAND'S 
PUBLICLY-STATED WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN RECONSTRUCTION 
IN IRAQ, WITH HUMANITARIAN AID AND PEACEKEEPERS. 
 
¶4. (C) THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHETHER THE AMBASSADOR THOUGHT A 
CONFLICT WAS INEVITABLE.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID SHE HAD 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 03        HELSIN  00262  071504Z 
OBSERVED THAT DIPLOMATS OFTEN ANSWER A QUESTION WITH A 
QUESTION.  FOLLOWING THAT MODEL, SHE ASKED WHETHER THE 
PRESIDENT THOUGHT SADDAM HAD ANY INTENTION OF FULLY 
DISARMING.  IT SEEMS HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF: IF HE DID 
NOT HONOR THE FIRST UNSC RESOLUTION ON IRAQ, WHAT IS THE 
CHANCE THAT HE WILL HONOR THE EIGHTEENTH? 
 
¶5. (C) THE PRESIDENT AND THE AMBASSADOR ALSO BRIEFLY 
DISCUSSED HALONEN'S BUSY SCHEDULE OF INTERNATIONAL VISITS 
OVER THE PAST YEAR.  PRESIDENT HALONEN SAID AGAIN HOW MUCH 
SHE APPRECIATED PRESIDENT BUSH'S MEETING WITH HER LAST APRIL, 
AND THANKED THE AMBASSADOR FOR HELPING ARRANGE THE VISIT, 
ALONG WITH CALLS ON JUSTICE O'CONNOR AND SENATOR HELMS.  IT 
IS CLEAR HALONEN IS ALSO STILL THINKING ABOUT HER VISIT TO 
CHINA LAST NOVEMBER.  SHE SAID THAT FOR MANY NATIONS THE 
FUTURE LIES IN WORKING WITH CHINA.  STILL THERE REMAINS MUCH 
FOR THE CHINESE TO DO IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS FIELD.  SHE NOTED 
THAT SHE HAD BEEN CRITICIZED FOR NOT TAKING A STRONGER STANCE 
ON THIS ISSUE DURING HER VISIT.  THE AMBASSADOR SAID THE SAME 
APPLIES TO IRAQ -- WHO HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS OF THE IRAQI PEOPLE?  WHERE IS THE INTERNATIONAL 
OUTRAGE OVER THE ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY SADDAM AGAINST HIS 
OWN PEOPLE? 
 
¶6. (C) COMMENT: WE ARE STRUCK BY HOW MUCH MORE MODERATE 
PRESIDENT HALONEN'S PUBLIC STATEMENTS ARE TODAY THAN EVEN TWO 
YEARS AGO.  ALTHOUGH FINLAND REMAINS A NON-ALIGNED NATION -- 
AND MANY FINNS REMAIN OUTRIGHT PACIFISTS -- HALONEN HAS MADE 
CLEAR IN A HIGH-PROFILE WAY HER VIEW THAT THE HEAT MUST BE 
KEPT ON SADDAM.  IN DECEMBER SHE AND PM LIPPONEN TOGETHER 
APPROVED FINLAND'S PUBLIC COMMITMENT TO AIDING IN 
                       CONFIDENTIAL 
 
PAGE 04        HELSIN  00262  071504Z 
POST-CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION IN IRAQ, AT A TIME WHEN NOT THAT 
MANY NATIONS HAD COME FORWARD WITH SUCH A COMMITMENT.  TO 
SOME EXTENT, SHE IS PROBABLY TRYING TO CLOSE RANKS WITH 
LIPPONEN, SINCE ELECTIONS ARE  IMMINENT (MARCH 16).  AND 
LIPPONEN HAS INDEED MADE USE OF HER STATEMENTS, ANSWERING 
OPPOSITION CRITICISM OF FINLAND'S IRAQ STANCE BY SAYING HIS 
GOVERNMEN IS IN LINE WITH THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY (REFTEL).
