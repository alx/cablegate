SUBJECT: CANADA SUPPORTS WTO BUDGET REFORM 
 
REF: STATE 50656 
 
¶1. Canada supports the U.S. objective, outlined Reftel, to 
reform the WTO budget process and move towards a two-year 
budget cycle, according to Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade Senior Trade Policy Officer Dean 
Steadman.  Steadman told Econoff that the WTO needs 
"results-based budgetary and accounting systems" and feels 
that moving towards a biennial budget process is one of a 
number of reforms that should be considered. Steadman will be 
the GOC point of contact on this issue. 
 
¶2. Steadman noted that he had raised the issue with the 
Canadian mission in Geneva during a visit last week.  He said 
that although his Geneva colleagues were supportive of the 
idea, they noted that the ongoing Doha round negotiations 
would make it difficult for them or others to focus on WTO 
budgetary reform at this time.
