SUBJECT: CANADA RATIFIES NATO ENLARGEMENT 
 
REF: USNATO 387 
 
(U) Two days after NATO signed the protocols on accession of 
the seven new members to NATO (reftel), Canada became the 
first country to ratify the protocols.  Prime Minister 
Chretien announced the ratification on March 28, saying that 
the new members bring to NATO "additional capabilities, 
extended geographical reach and greater security for the 
future."  COMMENT: GoC support for the seven was approved by 
Cabinet in July 2002, and reaffirmed by Cabinet in 
preparation for the NATO signing.  Expansion has been 
uncontroversial here, and Canadian ratification was almost a 
formality.  END COMMENT.
