¶1. (SBU) On September 6, DHS-ICE Attache delivered the 
Odyssey Customs import documents to Director of Aduanas 
Nicolas Bonilla, as requested by GOS via the Customs Mutual 
Assistance Agreement (CMAA) on July 24.  The DHS-ICE Attache 
advised Bonilla that the information was confidential and to 
be used only for law enforcement purposes.  Bonilla expressed 
appreciation for the information, and assured the DHS-ICE 
Attache that it would be used only for official purposes.  He 
added that Aduanas would make a formal request through DHS 
channels before sharing the documents with any other GOS 
agency.  Post advised MFA representatives of this exchange 
the afternoon of September 6. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Separately, the MFA sent Post a diplomatic note 
September 4 in response to the Ambassador's August 29 meeting 
with Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos (ref).  MFA 
officials advised us verbally that they will seek the Odyssey 
information through their Aduanas, acknowledging that Aduanas 
would first have to seek the necessary permission from DHS. 
Jorge Domecq, MFA's Deputy Director for Gibraltar Issues, 
noted that MFA was interested in obtaining the Odyssey 
customs information to provide to lawyers representing the 
GOS in the Tampa Admiralty Court. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Meanwhile, the Odyssey Explorer remains docked in 
Gibraltar and has not yet unloaded its cargo.  According to 
British Embassy representatives, Odyssey representatives have 
stated that the vessel will begin unloading its cargo the 
week of September 10. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Below is an informal translation of Foreign Ministry 
diplomatic note 277/31 dated August 31, which was provided to 
the Embassy on September 4.
