REF: A. STATE 129862 B. 02 OTTAWA 3092 
 
¶1. (U) Post delivered points contained ref A to Claudie 
Senay, Policy Advisor for Humanitarian Affairs in DFAIT's 
Human Rights, Humanitarian Affairs and International Women's 
Equality Division, on May 19. 
 
¶2. (U) In a follow-up discussion May 29, Senay said that 
Canada recognizes the importance of minority returns to 
Kosovo. In addition to funding from the Canadian 
International Development Agency (CIDA) for long-term 
development programs in Kosovo, GoC has provided funds to 
UNMIK's Housing and Property Directorate, which is 
responsible for establishing legal property titles and 
determining compensation for seized property. Senay said 
Canada is also providing funding to promote returns through 
the local initiatives program at its embassy in Pristina (ref 
B). 
 
¶3. (U) She said Canada would not commit to providing 
additional support for returns at this time, adding that CIDA 
will continue to consult with UNMIK about what steps can be 
taken to improve the returns climate.
