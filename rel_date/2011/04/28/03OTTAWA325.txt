SUBJECT: CANADA'S RESPONSE TO REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN 
CLEARING AFGHANISTAN'S IFI ARREARS:  "WE WILL DO OUR BEST 
TO RESPOND POSITIVELY" 
 
REF: STATE 27597 
 
 ¶1.  (U) As of late Friday afternoon (January 31) the GOC has 
still not announced its response to Treasury U/S Taylor's 
request for a contribution to cover Afghanistan's arrears to 
the IMF and World Bank.  That said, the outlook seems 
promising. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Working levels at the Canadian International 
Development Agency tell us they believe Minister Susan Whelan 
is waiting to announce the decision until after she has 
spoken with FinMin Ghani during Monday's conference call. 
James Junke, Director of the South Asia Division at the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, told us that the GOC 
has always responded positively to requests for assistance 
for Afghanistan, and is debating whether the contribution 
will come from new funds or reallocation of existing 
contributions. 
 
¶3.  (U) The GOC welcomed the information contained in reftel 
on the status of donations to cover Afghanistan's arrears. 
It was used for the briefing memo recommending contribution 
to clear the arrears, an exception from Canada's usual policy 
of avoiding use of development funds to pay arrears.
