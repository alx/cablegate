COMMITTEE 
 
REF: STATE 217408 
 
(SBU) Canada shares our view that repetitive resolutions are 
not making a positive contribution to the work of the UNGA 
First Committee (reftel), and will be working with us and the 
rest of the Western Group to develop concrete ideas on 
"rationalization."  That said, the GoC believes that reform 
will be limited by the G77/NAM and by the need to accommodate 
our allies.  Marina Laker, Foreign Affairs Deputy Director 
for Nonproliferation, said that the G77/NAM have linked UNGA 
reform to Security Council reform, and that allies having 
only a single contribution (e.g., Poland on CWC) will still 
want to introduce a resolution.  She added that on some 
long-standing issues there is new information/movement that 
should be brought up in the First Committee.
