SUBJECT: NETHERLANDS/GOLDSTONE: SAME REDLINES AS IN GENEVA 

REF: A. SECSTATE 112828 
¶B. THE HAGUE 615 

Classified By: PolEcon Counselor Andrew C. Mann for reasons 1.5(b,d) 

(C) Post conveyed reftel A points to key MFA staff covering 
the Middle East, the UN, and human rights. Lex Gerts, Deputy 
Head of the Human Rights Division, said the Dutch would apply 
the same redlines they used in Geneva to determine their vote 
on UNGA resolutions concerning the Goldstone report -- 
supporting the primary role of the Human Rights Council in 
evaluating the report, letting the parties conduct their own 
internal investigations, and permitting time for those 
investigations to take place. A deadline for further action 
or review would be appropriate in 5-6 months, as contemplated 
in the previous compromise to defer consideration of the 
report until March 2010. A deadline of 3 months would be too 
early. Gerts emphasized that the Dutch parliament fully 
supports this approach. (Note: The parliament's support 
follows a compromise reached within the governing coalition, 
reftel B, allowing the Dutch to oppose the Goldstone 
resolution at the Human Rights Council. End Note.)
