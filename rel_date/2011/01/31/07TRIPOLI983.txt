¶1.  Summary:  U.S. energy company Occidental Petroleum is set to 
announce a 25-year extension of its existing contracts in Libya. 
 This deal will include more than $13 billion in capital 
investment, and solidifies Occidental's position as a major 
player and top acreage holder in country.   End Summary. 
 
¶2.  In a bid to solidify control of its extensive acreage 
holdings in Libya, Occidential Petroleum (Oxy) is set to 
announce a 25-year extension to its contracts in Libya.  Oxy's 
CEO is expected to travel to Tripoli during the week of November 
25 to sign the new deal with the National Oil Corporation (NOC). 
 Under the terms of the extension, which has been under 
negotiation between Oxy and the NOC since January 2007, more 
than a dozen contracts set to expire in the 2009-10 timeframe 
will be extended for 25 years past 2007.  Oxy has agreed to pour 
more than $13 billion into exploration, field development and 
infrastructure upgrades as part of this arrangement.  Oxy will 
also reportedly gain additional production rights with its 
current NOC-owned partner Zuetina, as well as Sirte Basin 
production from another NOC company, the Arabian Gulf Oil 
Company (AGOCO).  The general terms of the new agreement will 
follow the NOC template used in the most recent Exploration and 
Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA) rounds, although there will 
reportedly be some flexibility on the terms of the production 
share of production that Oxy will receive from future 
discoveries. 
 
¶3.  This deal will solidify Oxy's position as one of the top, if 
not the top, international oil company (IOCs) in Libya.  Oxy 
resumed operations in Libya in July 2005, nineteen years after 
departing the country following its conclusion of a "standstill" 
agreement with Libyan authorities.  Thanks in part to its 
success in the January 2005 EPSA bid round (in which it won 
acreage in nine different areas), Oxy is the largest net total 
of oil and gas acreage in Libya, with a total exploration and 
production acreage in Libya of approximately 130,000 square 
kilometers.  Oxy is both the largest holder of onshore acreage 
in Libya, with over 30 million acres, and also has whole or 
partial interest over more than 12 million acres of offshore 
territory, which it either controls outright or as a 35% 
shareholder in partnership with Australia's Woodside (55%) and 
UAE's Liwa (10%).  Also, although it subcontracts all of its 
field operations, Oxy is one of the largest employers of 
American citizens in Libya, with anywhere from 15 to 20 
employees at any given time.  Libya is a critical market for 
Oxy.  The company expended more than 70% of its worldwide 
exploration budget in Libya in 2006.  The $13 billion work plan 
envisioned under this new deal will only increase Libya's 
importance to Oxy.
