(C) Pol Chief presented reftel points to the Icelandic Ministry for 
Foreign Affairs Defense Department on the morning of June 6.  MFA 
Defense Department Counsellor Fridrik Jonsson contacted Pol Chief 
later in the day to report that Iceland shares the USG's concern over 
the Russian approach to revising the Treaty on Conventional Forces in 
Europe (CFE).  Jonsson added that the Icelandic delegation to the 
High Level Task Force (HLTF) on June 7 had been informed of the U.S. 
position.  The GOI is strongly hoping that the HLTF produces a 
unified Alliance approach.  "Otherwise, the Russians will exploit any 
difference of position between Allies," he observed.
