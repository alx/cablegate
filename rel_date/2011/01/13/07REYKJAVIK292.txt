SUBJECT: ICELAND: VERY SUPPORTIVE OF RESOLUTION AGAINST USE OF RAPE 
AS INSTRUMENT OF STATE POLICY 
 
REF:  STATE 135255 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Pol Chief passed reftel draft resolution to Ingibjorg 
Davidsdottir, Counsellor for Human Rights at the  Icelandic Ministry 
for Foreign Affairs on 26 September, and followed up to present 
reftel talking points on 1 October.  Davidsdottir reported that the 
draft resolution looked like something that Iceland could easily 
support and would likely move to co-sponsor.  She took on board Pol 
Chief's cautions regarding amendments that would clearly block U.S. 
sponsorship for the resolution. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  Iceland is a near-certain supporter and/or 
co-sponsor of the resolution, particularly in the context of 
comments to the press by the Foreign Minister during her visit to 
UNGA.  In those statements, the Minister lauded the Secretary's 
Women Leaders' Working Group and the useful discussion there 
regarding organized mass rapes and their use as an instrument of 
state policy.
