Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir and MFA Environmental Counselor Bjarni 
Sigtryggsson on January 24.  Gisladottir agreed it would be good for

its electricity and home heating, to send a strong delegation and 
she will consider attending provided her schedule allows.

that the Ministry of Industry had expressed interest in attending 
the conference and suggested that post follow up directly with that 
Ministry as well.

Evans.  Her email is Evansfs@state.gov and her direct telephone is 
+354-562-9100, ext. 2295.
