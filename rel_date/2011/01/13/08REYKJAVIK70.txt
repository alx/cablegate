¶1.  (SBU) Pol Chief briefly mentioned reftel declaration to 
Ingibjorg Davidsdottir, Counsellor for Human Rights at the Icelandic 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs on 22 April and followed up with a 
detailed demarche the next day.  Davidsdottir replied that she had 
spoken with Iceland's UN Mission after the previous day's 
conversation, and after reviewing the draft declaration instructed 
the mission to add Iceland to the list of signatories.  "I told them 
it would be scandalous if we didn't support this," commented 
Davidsdottir.
