Supplementary Agreements, 
 
Recalling in particular that in its resolution 1721 (2006) it 
notably endorsed the decision of the African Union Peace and 
Security Council on the mandate of the Head of State, and 
recalling further that in the statement of its President 
dated 28 March 2007 (S/PRST/2007/8) it endorsed the 
Ouagadougou Political Agreement, including its Chapter V on 
the institutional executive framework, and that this 
Agreement provided for a period of ten months for the holding 
of the presidential elections, 
 
Expressing again its appreciation to President Blaise 
Compaor of Burkina Faso ("the Facilitator") for his 
continued efforts to support the peace process in Cte 
d,Ivoire, in particular through the Ouagadougou Political 
Agreement follow-up mechanisms, commending and encouraging 
the continued efforts of the African Union and the Economic 
Community of West African States ("ECOWAS") to promote peace 
and stability in Cte d,Ivoire, and reiterating its full 
support for them, 
 
Stressing again the importance of the international 
consultative organ participating in the meetings of the 
evaluation and monitoring committee, as an observer, 
 
Stressing the need for the Council to pursue a rigorous, 
strategic approach to peacekeeping deployments, 
 
Reiterating its strong condemnation of any attempt to 
destabilize the peace process by force, and expressing its

such attempt, on the basis of a report by the 
Secretary-General, 
 
Having taken note of the report of the Secretary-General 
dated 7 July 2009 (S/2009/344), 
 
Recalling its resolution 1674 (2006) on the protection of 
civilians in armed conflicts, noting with concern, in spite 
of the sustained improvement of the overall human rights 
situation, the persistence of reported human rights 
violations against civilians in different parts of the 
country, including numerous acts of sexual violence, 
stressing that the perpetrators must be brought to justice, 
and reiterating its firm condemnation of all violations of 
human rights and international humanitarian law in Cte 
d,Ivoire, 
 
Recalling its resolution 1612 (2005) on children and armed

the implementation of the mandate of the United Nations 
Operation in Cte d,Ivoire ("UNOCI"), 
 
Determining that the situation in Cte d,Ivoire continues to 
pose a threat to international peace and security in the 
region, 
 
Acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, 
 
("Supporting the Ouagadougou political process")

demonstrate their political commitment towards the holding of 
free, fair, open and transparent elections; 
 
¶2. Reiterates its determination to bring its full support to 
a credible electoral process for the presidential and 
legislative elections in Cte d,Ivoire and expresses its 
conviction that any postponement of the presidential 
elections of 29 November 2009 in Cte d,Ivoire would be 
inconsistent with a credible process and with the Ouagadougou 
Political Agreement as endorsed by the Security Council; 
 
¶3. Welcomes the successful completion of the operations of 
registration of voters; 
 
¶4. Recalls that it had requested in its resolution 1865

lists, encourages the Facilitator and the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General to inform it without

standards, and reaffirms its full support to the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General in his certification 
role,

framework referred to in document S/2008/250 and after 
inclusive contacts with all stakeholders in Cte d,Ivoire, 
including the civil society; 
 
¶9. Stresses the importance of an inclusive participation of 
the Ivorian civil society in the electoral process, and of 
ensuring the equal protection of and respect for human rights 
of every Ivorian as they relate to the electoral system, and 
in particular respect for freedom of opinion and expression, 
and removing obstacles and challenges to women,s 
participation and full involvement in public life; 
 
¶10. Urges the Government of Cte d,Ivoire to provide the 
operators involved in the electoral process with the 
necessary support and encourages the international community 
to continue their support to the electoral process, including 
by providing, with the agreement of the Ivorian authorities, 
electoral observation capacity and related technical 
assistance; 
 
¶11. Recalls that it is fully prepared to impose targeted 
measures pursuant to paragraph 16 of resolution 1842 (2008), 
including among other things against persons who are 
determined to be a threat to the peace and national 
reconciliation process in Cte d,Ivoire, and recalls further 
that, pursuant to paragraph 6 of the above mentioned 
resolution, any threat to the electoral process in Cte 
d,Ivoire, in particular any attack or obstruction of the 
action of the Independent Electoral Commission in charge of 
the organization of the elections or the actions of the 
operators mentioned in paragraphs 1.33, and 2.11 of the 
Ouagadougou Political Agreement, shall constitute a threat to 
the peace and national reconciliation process for the 
purposes of paragraph 9 and 11 of resolution 1572 (2004); 
 
¶12. Urges again the political parties to comply fully with 
the Code of Good Conduct for elections which they signed 
under the auspices of the Secretary-General, and in 
particular urges the Ivorian authorities to allow equitable 
access to public media; 
 
¶13. Takes note again of the ceremony of transfer of authority 
held in Bouake on 26 May 2009 as a positive development, 
urges the Ivorian parties to make further progress to advance 
the reunification and disarmament processes, and encourages 
the international donors to continue to provide their support 
to them, as appropriate;

protection of women and children is addressed in the 
implementation of the Ouagadougou Political Agreement as well 
as the post-conflict reconstruction and recovery phases, 
including continued monitoring and reporting of the situation 
of women and children and that all reported abuses are 
investigated and those responsible brought to justice; 
 
¶15. Calls also upon all Ivorian parties to take appropriate 
measures to refrain from, prevent and protect civilians from 
all forms of sexual violence, which could include, inter 
alia, enforcing appropriate military disciplinary measures, 
upholding the principle of command responsibility, and 
training troops on the categorical prohibition of all forms 
of sexual violence; 
 
¶16. Recalls the recommendation by its Working Group on 
children in armed conflict in Cte d,Ivoire (S/AC.51/2008/5) 
that a National Action Plan to address sexual violence be 
adopted, welcomes steps taken so far and urges the Government 
of Cote d,Ivoire, with the support of UNOCI and other 
relevant actors to finalize and implement it, welcomes also 
the Programme of Action to Combat Sexual Violence in the 
areas within its control signed by the Forces Nouvelles in 
January 2009 pursuant to the above-mentioned recommendations 
as well as the communiqu issued by four militia groups 
indicating their willingness to combat sexual violence, and 
calls upon all relevant parties, with the continued support 
of UNOCI to work together to implement their commitments; 
 
¶17. Urges the signatories of the Ouagadougou Political 
Agreement to take the necessary steps to protect vulnerable 
civilian populations, including by guaranteeing the voluntary
