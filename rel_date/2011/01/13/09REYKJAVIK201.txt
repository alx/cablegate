¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered request contained in reftel to Sveinn 
Magnusson, Chief Medical Advisor at the Ministry of Health on 
November 3.  Mr. Magnusson told Econoff that Iceland, as elsewhere, 
has been slow to receive the quantity of H1N1 vaccines ordered. 
Currently, the vaccine is available only to individuals in the high 
risk categories.  Approximately 80 percent of those eligible have 
opted to receive the vaccine.  The vaccine will be made available to 
the general public, by appointment, at the end of this month. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Magnusson thanked Econoff for information regarding the 
request for WHO assistance but stated that Iceland is unable to 
provide any contributions to the WHO at this time.  He anticipates 
that there will be no surplus of the vaccine after inoculations are 
completed.  Magnusson also said, however, that he will keep the 
request in mind should Iceland's situation change to where it might 
be in a position to contribute.
