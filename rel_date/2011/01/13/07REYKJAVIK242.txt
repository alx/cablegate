(SBU) Post followed up on Ref A points at a meeting with Icelandic 
MFA Counsellor for Human Rights Ingibjorg Davidsdottir August 21. 
Davidsdottir replied that during her previous service in Geneva she 
became quite familiar with Felice Gaer's on the UN Committee Against 
Torture. Davidsdottir noted that she would recommend that Iceland 
support Ms. Gaer's candidacy, and that this support would most 
likely be provided.  She pledged to respond with a concrete response 
as soon as one becomes available, but cautioned that this was 
unlikely until just before the election.
