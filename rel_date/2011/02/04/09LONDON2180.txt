¶1.  (S) HMG will adopt a "supportive position" regarding President Obama's decision about European-based missile defense, Judith Gough (Protect), Deputy Head of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Security Policy Group, told Poloff September 17. (Ref)  She said that HMG "would like to help" by expressing support for the President's decision. She stated that there has been a great deal of "scrutiny and questions" from the British public and, to a lesser extent, from Parliament regarding U.S. missile defense plans.  

¶2.  (S)  Gough and John Saltford (Protect), Deputy Team Leader for Missile Defense and Space Security in the FCO's Security Policy Group, stated that the President's announcement would engender a series of questions in the media, including whether there was an agreement struck with Russia.  (Note:  British media coverage has included analysis and speculation about the nexus between U.S.-Russian relations and the missile defense decision.  End Note.)  They also asked whether Poland would still receive Patriot missiles, now that now that ground-based interceptors would no longer be deployed in Poland.  

PM Brown's Public Statement ---------------------------  

¶3.  (SBU)  Prime Minister Brown stated at a press conference in Brussels September 17 that "I strongly support the decision that is being made by President Obama today."  John Saltford told Poloff September 18 that he was not aware of any other public HMG reaction to President Obama's announcement.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX edKingdom
