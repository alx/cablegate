¶1.  (C)  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has sent briefing materials to posts around the world to "encourage Embassies to lobby" and to "add weight to what the U.S. has already done" to support the NSG draft exception text for India, Sarah Hulton, the Head of the FCO's WMD Controls Policy Section, Counterproliferation Department, told PolOff August 12.  Hulton underscored that the UK would remain "in very close touch" with the U.S. team heading the  effort in the lead up to the August 21-22 NSG plenary, adding that the UK would continue to reach out to NSG members and that a next step could be a "P-3 call, soon" to discuss strategy.  She expressed interest in learning more about what the U.S. was doing to gain support for the NSG draft exception text, noting that the "key themes" (reftel) would be a useful tool when HMG articulated arguments in support of the draft text.
