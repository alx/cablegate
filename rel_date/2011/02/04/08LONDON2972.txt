LEGISLATION  REF: A. SECSTATE 123492      B. USEU 1629      C. STATE 99217  1. (SBU)  Post delivered ref A points to the host government on November 21 regarding the EU's biofuels sustainability proposals under consideration for a vote by the European Parliament in its "20-20-20" Energy and Climate Legislation. In response to USG comments on the amendments, the UK Head of the Biofuels Policy Branch of Department for Transport stated the amendments are a starting point for negotiations, but expects that they will change.  In addition, the UK is recommending that the EU incorporate indirect land use change sustainability criteria into the EU's legislation.  The UK is discussing this recommendation with the EU this week.  Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
