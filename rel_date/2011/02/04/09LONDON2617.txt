Closing Remarks ---------------  

¶74. (SBU)  Under Secretary Tauscher stated she was grateful to Her Majesty's Government for putting together this Conference.  She enjoyed the opportunity to get to know her P5 colleagues, and hoped this effort would lay a good foundation for further collaboration on the important issues raised during this Conference.  The Obama Administration was committed to strengthening the NPT as the basis of the international nuclear nonproliferation regime.  The Conference had enhanced understanding among the P5 concerning the verification and compliance challenges associated with nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament, as well as demonstrating that the P5 could work together to meet NPT Article VI commitments and related issues in preparation for next year's Review Conference.  The United States would consider carefully the issues and recommendations raised during this Conference.  

¶75.  (SBU)  Leslie (UK) stated that there was joint agreement to remain in touch regarding a common approach to the NPT Review Conference, with a view of using the conference constructively.  The specific timing of such continued cooperation remained to be determined; however, the P5 committed to share their calendars of upcoming dates.  The UK was committed to meeting again, and noted a willingness on the part of the rest of the P5 to continue to cooperate.  One such area for further cooperation was the development of a glossary in each of the P5 languages for terminology.  

¶76.  (SBU)  He (China) noted that China and the United States had conducted work on developing a glossary, and he could agree in principle to working on one in the P5 context. Ryabkov (Russia) shared the optimism of those who valued cooperation with the United States and the other P5, and looked forward to further work in this area.  Leslie (UK) said that she looked to China and Russia to work on a proposal for a working group to discuss establishment of a P5 glossary.  She noted that, in the area of nuclear accident response, it was not possible to agree to form a working group at this time; however, she encouraged each state to consider possible ways forward, and asked Sankey to report back on the progress made by the P5 in this regard.
