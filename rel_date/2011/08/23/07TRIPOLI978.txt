¶1. (SBU) ExxonMobil has clinched a deal with Libya's National 
Oil Corporation to increase its acreage in the country by about 
fifty percent.  The soon-to-be announced deal is for a giant 
offshore bloc adjacent to another it secured in the December 
2006 Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA) bidding 
round.  The latest move marks another step for ExxonMobil 
towards regaining a major share in the Libyan market, which it 
dominated before it left the country in 1986. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Econoff learned on November 20 that ExxonMobil will 
announce soon that it was awarded today a vast new offshore area 
to explore for hydrocarbon resources.  The area in question 
covers more than 2.5 million square acres, and is located 
roughly 100 miles off the central Libyan coast.  The new area is 
said to be in deep water, requiring world-class deepwater 
operations that are performed by only a handful of international 
oil companies.  The parcel, referred to as Area 21, is adjacent 
to another identically-sized concession awarded to ExxonMobil as 
part of the Exploration and Production Sharing (EPSA) bid round 
process that concluded in December 2006.  ExxonMobil had 
previously secured another large offshore parcel (area 44), 
located along the Egyptian-Libyan maritime border, in the EPSA 
bid round that concluded in October 2005. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post has learned that the workplan for this area will 
be substantial, to include 4,000km of 2D seismic, 2,000km of 3D 
seismic and the drilling of at least one well.  Terms of a 
signing bonus, production share and other features of the deal 
were not disclosed. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  While significant, particularly in terms of 
the quantity of more labor-intensive and costly 3D seismic, this 
set of requirements is significantly smaller in scope than that 
attendant to ExxonMobil's winning bid in the most recent EPSA 
round in December 2006 (20,000km of 2D, 1,000km of 3D, 4 wells, 
and a $10 million signing bonus).  The formal EPSA bid rounds 
have become increasingly competitive since they were inaugurated 
in January 2005.  The less demanding requirements for the Area 
21 deal underscore the potential advantages for IOC's of 
concluding deals outside the EPSA rubric.  Securing Area 21also 
places ExxonMobil in the top tier of offshore operators in Libya 
and marks the company's return to the head of the pack in a 
market it first opened to oil and gas operations with the 
discovery of Libya's first viable oilfield in 1960.  End 
comment.
