SUBJECT: LIBYAN OFFICIALS CONFIRM AUGUST 31 AU MEETING IN TRIPOLI 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a July 26 meeting with NEA Acting Assistant 
Secretary Feltman (septel), Foreign Minister-equivalent Musa 
Kusa extended a verbal invitation for American officials to 
attend an African Union extraordinary session on August 31 
focused on continental crises, specifically Sudan and Somalia. 
On July 27, Protocol chief Nuri al-Mismari told the Ambassador 
that the one-day session would be held in Tripoli and that the 
GOL was in the process of chartering ships to serve as floating 
hotels to house the expected delegates.  The proposed 
ministerial-level meeting would be the day following a planned 
visit of Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi to mark the signing of the 
2008 Italian-Libyan "Friendship Treaty" on August 30 and the 
40th anniversary of the coup that brought Muammar al-Qadhafi to 
power on September 1.
