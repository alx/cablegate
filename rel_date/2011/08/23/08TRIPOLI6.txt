SUBJECT: LIBYA IMPOSES NEW CURRENCY REQUIREMENT FOR TOURISTS 
 
REF: 07 TRIPOLI 987 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post received January 3 a copy of a note sent from the 
GOL's Civil Aviation Committee to airlines announcing that as of 
7 January, all tourist visa holders -- except bearers of 
Egyptian and Tunisian passports -- will be required to present 
USD 1000 or the equivalent in another convertible currency as a 
requirement for entry to Libya.  On January 6, the Consular 
Section was able to confirm with the MFA's Head of Consular 
Affairs, Ahmed Ameish, that the law would take effect January 7. 
  Ameish stated that travelers checks, bank statements and 
credit cards would not/not be accepted; the requirement is for 
"currency". (Note: The Egyptian and Tunisian Embassies have 
confirmed that their citizens are not/not subject to the new 
requirement. End note.) 
¶2. (SBU) Similar to the passport translation requirement 
(reftel), this law has apparently been on the books for a number 
of years, but was not enforced in the recent past.  Ameish 
provided no reason for the change. 
¶3. (SBU) Foreign airlines (British, KLM, Swissair, Lufthansa) 
indicate that they will not/not be checking currency holdings at 
the time of check-in at European airports.  As in the case of 
the passport translation, it is not clear to us, other 
diplomatic missions or the airlines how the currency requirement 
will be implemented.  We will likely only obtain a clearer 
picture over time as the parameters of who is turned back shape 
up.  The U.K. and Italian Embassies are advising on their 
respective Foreign Office websites that citizens from their 
countries traveling on tourist visas comply with the new rule. 
¶4. (SBU) The Embassy received notification of this requirement 
via a copy of the Civil Aviation notice that was sent to 
airlines, which Swissair forwarded to us. We received no 
notification from the GOL.  We learned from the U.K. Embassy on 
January 6 that the Libyan People's Bureau in Rome notified EU 
embassies there about ten days ago that the new requirement 
would be implemented. The EU Embassies in Tripoli learned about 
the currency requirement shortly after the New Year's holiday 
from their counterparts in Rome and have since met in Tripoli to 
discuss options for engaging the GOL. 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  There is considerable speculation as to the 
reasons for implementation of the rule. The U.K. and Italian 
missions are convinced that the new strictures will be broadly 
applied; the German and Dutch missions have insisted they will 
not apply to European and North American travelers. Citing 
unconfirmed reports, the latter contend that the strictures are 
designed to prevent more sub-Saharan African guest workers from 
entering Libya. While it is not clear which sub-Saharan Africans 
are able to enter Libya visa-free and which obtain tourist visas 
on arrival, the Civil Aviation note specifies that even citizens 
of countries exempted from entry visa requirements are subject 
to the new rule (except, again, Egyptians and Tunisians).  As 
with the passport translation issue, the MFA was unable to 
articulate any reason for the currency requirement (beyond that 
it was already on the books), nor did it provide any advance 
notice to missions in Libya.  Both changes will be enforced by 
Immigration, rather than the MFA's Consular Affairs Department. 
End comment.
