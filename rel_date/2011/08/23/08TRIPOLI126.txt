SUBJECT: WAHDA BANK PRIVATIZATION BID WON BY JORDAN-BASED ARAB BANK 
 
REF: 07 TRIPOLI 885 
 
¶1. (SBU)  In a move that adds momentum to Libya's promising 
banking reform efforts, the Libyan Central Bank announced that 
the Jordan-based Arab Bank won the tendering process to buy 19 
percent of Libya's Wahda Bank.  According to press reports, Arab 
Bank's winning bid of 210 million euros ($310 million) easily 
outstripped the second highest bid of 121 million euros ($180 
million) by Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corporation.  Other 
short-listed bidders falling short of the mark were Morocco's 
Attijariwafa Bank, Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo. and French bank 
Societe Generale (Note: Societe Generale announced its 
withdrawal from the competition on February 12 for undisclosed 
reasons; Econoff subsequently learned the bank was uncomfortable 
with elements of the shareholding agreement. End Note). 
According to a fact sheet issued by Libya's Central Bank, Wahda 
Bank is the country's second largest commercial bank in terms of 
total loan portfolio, with a market share of over 20%.  It is 
the fifth largest commercial bank in terms of total assets, with 
1.7 billion euros ($2.6 billion) and 71 branches throughout the 
country. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The shares obtained by Arab Bank were previously owned 
by the Libyan Economic and Social Development Fund (ESDF), which 
held 73 percent of Wahda before the sale.  With this sale, the 
ESDF still has a majority stake of 54 percent, but Arab Bank 
will assume management control of Wahda.  The remaining Wahda 
shares are currently held by the Libyan Central Bank (14 
percent) and a collection of Libyan investors and companies (13 
percent).  Under the terms of its purchase, Arab Bank will have 
the right to eventually raise its stake in Wahda Bank to 51 
percent over the next three to five years. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Comment: This sale marks the second successful 
privatization of a Libyan commercial bank, following a similar 
deal struck with France's BNP Paribas in its purchase of a 19 
percent stake in Sahara Bank in September 2007 (reftel).  The 
Central Bank continues to draw on foreign expertise for pushing 
through its banking reform strategy, with McKinsey and Company 
(strategic advisor), Rothschild (financial advisor), Baker and 
McKenzie (legal) and KPMG (accountants) all playing substantial 
roles.  With the privatizations of Wahda and Sahara well in 
hand, the next target for the Central Bank will be solidifying 
its December 2007 merger of the state-owned Jamahiriya and Umma 
Banks into a single entity, the Libyan Bank.  End comment.
