¶1. (SBU) Summary: Recent legislation making it easier for 
plaintiffs in terrorism-related lawsuits to seize foreign 
government-owned assets to satisfy U.S. court judgments has 
caused concern among U.S. firms partnered with Libyan companies 
(especially in the energy sector), and provoked a sharply 
negative reaction from the GOL.  U.S. companies are attempting 
to clarify and reduce their potential exposure under section 
1083 of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act (aka, "the 
Lautenberg Amendment").  The Libyan National Oil Corporation 
(NOC) has informed American oil companies that it is "their 
problem" to solve, and has begun requiring U.S. and other 
companies to conduct all operations in non-dollar denominations. 
 A senior MFA official warned the CDA that this law could set 
back US-Libyan relations.  The MFA has pressed European 
governments not to cooperate with U.S. judicial efforts to 
attach Libyan assets in Europe under the law.  End summary. 
 
 
OIL PRODUCING & OIL SERVICES COMPANIES AT GREATEST RISK 
 
¶2.  (SBU) U.S. companies participating in joint venture 
partnerships with Libyan national oil companies assess 
themselves as being at greatest risk under section 1083 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act.  This list includes 
Occidental, ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Amerada Hess.  These 
companies are involved in jointly developing Libyan oilfields 
and in extracting and lifting crude oil.  The three U.S. 
partners in the Oasis Group (Marathon, ConocoPhillips and 
Amerada Hess, who are partnered with Libyan state firm Waha) pay 
$2 million/month to the GOL in operating fees, and $100 
million/month in taxes and royalties.  Company reps assess that 
these payments -- as well as jointly-held facilities and 
equipment -- would be exposed to court-ordered attachment and 
seizure under section 1083.  U.S. oil service companies, such as 
Halliburton, may also be exposed, according to local company 
reps, and most service companies have frozen further expansion 
until the risks are clarified.  Company reps have expressed 
concern to us that their GOL partner companies would view any 
U.S. court-ordered attachments of payments or equipment as a 
breach of contract, potentially leading to termination of their 
work in Libya. 
 
3.(SBU) U.S. companies engaged exclusively in the exploration 
(as distinct from production), such as Chevron and ExxonMobil, 
assess themselves to be subject to less risk for the moment, 
since they make no regular payments to the GOL that would be 
subject to attachment (the signing bonuses agreed in connection 
with winning their Exploration and Production Sharing (EPSA) 
agreements have already been paid to the GOL, and day-to-day 
exploration work is contracted out to largely non-GOL entities). 
 Nevertheless, company reps say that they are concerned about 
the longer-term impact of this legislation on their future plans 
in Libya. 
 
NOC REACTS SWIFTLY 
 
4 (SBU)  Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) has instructed 
all international partner companies to cease conducting 
transactions in U.S. dollars.  U.S. oil company contacts have 
privately told us that the NOC's intent was to reduce its 
exposure to U.S. courts, since dollar transactions are routed 
through the U.S. financial system.  The edict has disrupted the 
payments system in the energy sector, which has traditionally 
used the dollar. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The NOC's chairman, Shukri Ghanem, informed U.S. firms 
in late January that they were "on their own" to resolve the 
problems caused by the new legislation, hinting that the firms 
would suffer the consequences for any U.S. court-ordered 
disruption of their operations in Libya.  U.S. company reps have 
told us that they believe that the NOC could find them in breach 
of their contractual obligations if U.S. courts disrupt their 
monthly payment of operational fees to the NOC. 
 
GOL NOT PLEASED 
 
¶6. (SBU) Senior MFA adviser Abdelati Obeidi told CDA that the 
GOL viewed the Act as a potentially serious setback to US-Libyan 
relations.  He said the GOL understood that the initiative had 
come from the Congress, but did not understand why the 
Administration failed to block it, or at least its application 
to Libya, as it had done in the case of Iraq. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Separately, according to European and ex-Soviet bloc 
diplomats in Tripoli, the GOL has pressed their governments not 
to cooperate with any U.S. judicial efforts to attachment Libyan

assets in Europe under the Act.  One European diplomat expressed 
surprise at the sharp edge of the Libyan demarche, noting that 
their GOL interlocutor had threatened unspecified consequences 
for the country's commercial interests in Libya if the country 
facilitated seizure of Libyan assets pursuant to U.S. claims. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Comment:  The enactment of section 1083, together with 
the mid-January $6 billion U.S. court judgment against Libya in 
the UTA airliner case, has caused deep concern among U.S. energy 
companies operating in Libya and consternation within the GOL. 
The companies are analyzing their exposure; the GOL is 
misinterpreting these developments as deliberate slights or, in 
the words of Obeidi, "a return to the era of sanctions."  Both 
are waiting to see how section 1083 will be applied, hoping, of 
course, that it will not be.  End comment.
