REF: TRIPOLI 765 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  On September 30, 2009, Libya's National Oil 
Corporation (NOC) published on its website a notice that the 
Secretary of the General People's Committee (prime 
minister-equivalent) issued a decree designating Ali Sugheir to 
assume the functions of the Secretary of NOC Management 
Committee (also commonly referred to as Chairman) in addition to 
the functions already entrusted to him as a NOC Director 
General.  Sugheir, who was already Acting Chairman of the NOC 
(reftel), thereby replaces Shokri Ghanem as the head of the 
state-owned company. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Biographic Note:  Born in Benghazi in 1959, Sugheir has 
been the Director General of the NOC since 2008.  Prior to 
joining the NOC, he was chairman of Sirte Oil Company, which is 
considered one of the most important of the NOC's subsidiaries. 
A graduate of Glasgow University in the UK, Sugheir was promoted 
to chairman after a stint as exploration manager.  He is also a 
graduate of the University of Garyounis (Benghazi) where he 
studied Geology. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: The promotion of Sugheir follows the 
prediction of diplomats in Tripoli that a technocrat would be 
named to replace Shokri Ghanem, a prominent politician and 
former prime minister (2003-2005).  However, some industry 
insiders believe that the announcement is not the permanent 
appointment and is simply a resolution confirming Sugheir as 
interim Chair.  They expect Ghanem, who is reportedly close to 
Saif al-Islam al-Qadhafi, to make a return to politics.  End 
comment.
