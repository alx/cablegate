At Madrid, Bahrain pledged in-kind training for Iraqi central 
bankers and bankers.  The details were to be worked out 
between Bahrain's and Iraq's central banks.  In November, the 
Governor of the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) advised that 
Iraq's central bank governor promised to visit Bahrain after 
Ramadan to discuss the training offer and other bilateral 
financial issues.  The BMA Governor told us recently that he 
is prepared to host his Iraqi counterpart when he can find 
time in his schedule for a visit to Bahrain.
