SUBJECT: MANAMA'S REQUEST FOR FY04 BFIF FUNDING 
 
REF: STATE 242589, 03 STATE 335536 
 
¶1. SUMMARY: Manama requests USD 7000 in funding from the 
FY04 Business Facilitation Incentive Fund (BFIF) to 
establish and equip a resource center for a new chapter of 
the American Chamber of Commerce in Bahrain. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. BACKGROUND: In FY03, BFIF supported AmCham Bahrain 
formation by funding visits from AmCham Cairo 
representatives to Bahrain to discuss the purpose and 
importance of an AmCham for the U.S. business community to 
reinforce and coalesce increase interest in the formation of 
an AmCham in Bahrain.  Later, BFIF funded U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce's John Howard's travel to Bahrain to work with a 
core AmCham formation committee on by-laws and a business 
plan for the group.  In consultation with John Howard, these 
documents have been revised.  The formation committee is now 
preparing translations of their by-laws and business plan to 
present to the Government of Bahrain.  Positive meetings 
with the GOB, including those with the AmCham delegation 
from Cairo as well as with John Howard, lead us to believe 
that GOB accreditation will be unproblematic.  The formation 
committee anticipates presenting its credentials to the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce this spring, and to be up and running 
soon thereafter. 
 
¶3. With bilateral Free Trade Agreement negotiations 
underway, U.S. business interest in Bahrain and Bahraini 
business interest in the U.S. has increased.  The 
seriousness of this interest is substantiated by requests 
for International Company Profiles (ICPs) and Gold Key 
Service not seen in previous years at this embassy.  A 
bilateral Free Trade Agreement should push this trend.  The 
new AmCham could augment Embassy matchmaking efforts through 
its own programs. 
 
¶4. Post requests funding to establish and equip an American 
Chamber of Commerce Resource Center in Bahrain.  The 
information-age Center could be a nexus for up-to-date 
matchmaking information searches, market research and 
industrial trends on a local and global level.  To assure 
that the AmCham is able to provide added value through 
current information beyond what is readily available to the 
average internet user, we are requesting an internet-ready 
laptop computer and printer together with subscriptions to 
online searchable data services.   These resources will give 
the members and visitors access to active tenders and 
project details in addition to commercial and economic news 
in the local, regional and global market.  The laptop, 
together with an all-in-one printer/scanner/fax machine and 
a projector can serve double duty, as AmCham office 
equipment to prepare brochures and invitations, and to make 
presentations designed to drive and inform membership.  We 
anticipate that these resources will contribute to making 
the AmCham Resource Center a destination for the business 
community in Bahrain.
