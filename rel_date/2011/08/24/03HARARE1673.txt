SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION SADC MUTUAL DEFENSE PACT HAILED; 
HARARE 
 
  ¶1.   Under headline "SADC Mutual Defense Pact welcome 
      development" the August 25 edition of the government- 
      controlled daily "The Herald" carried the following 
      op-ed by Caesar Zvayi: 
 
  ¶2.   ". . .The events of September 11, 2001 an obvious 
      backlash by the disgruntled bullied, provided the 
      ¶U. S. with a much-needed cover for its imperialist 
      drive by launching the so-called `war on 
      terror. . .,'  What is interesting about these 
      `search wars' is that the declared reasons for war 
      are never found but each time strong governments are 
      always removed to pave way for spineless Western 
      stooges. . .The countries that have been targeted by 
      the U. S. and its running dog, Britain, all have two 
      things in common.  The first is revolutionary 
      governments and strong leaders that are unflinching 
      in the face of bullish overtures from Washington or 
      London.  The second attribute being the possession 
      of strategic natural resources that are in great 
      demand in the Group of 8.  Both of these attributes 
      abound in the SADC region, which is probably the 
      reason why both Bush and Blair embarked on their 
      African safaris to assess their chances under the 
      guise of philanthropy. . .In this scheme of things, 
      revolutionary governments have to pave way for 
      stooges who would open up the enormous resources 
      abounding in such countries to free plunder by 
      Western overlords. . .These factors make the SADC 
      region a target of the new imperialist vision which 
      is the reason why the drafting of the SADC Mutual 
      Defense Pact. . .is a welcome development that is 
      bound to ensure the collective security of member 
      states. . .A united SADC defense force will act as a 
      deterrent to the machinations of the Western 
      overlords in this unipolar world.  The moral 
      decadence and abuse of power by the U. S, and UK was 
      probably foreseen by former U. S. President F. D. 
      Roosevelt where he said: `The means by which we live 
      have outdistanced the ends for which we live for we 
      have guided missiles and misguided man.'  How 
      prophetic these words are in the third millennium 
      where two misguided men, Bush and Blair, are using 
      pre-emptive strikes to launch guided missiles on 
      defenseless nations in a so-called war on 
      terror. . .and a search for WMD by using WMD!  What 
      double standards?"
