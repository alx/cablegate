SUBJECT: UK UNABLE TO COMMIT TO SENDING REPRESENTATIVE TO 
JANUARY'S GICNT EPG MEETING 
 
REF: SECSTATE 100994 
 
¶1. (SBU) Together with Russian Embassy colleagues, Poloff 
delivered reftel joint demarche to Sharon McDonald, CBRN 
Terrorism Desk Officer in the Counter-Proliferation 
Department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), on 
October 14.  McDonald told Poloff and Sergei Andiashin of the 
Russian Embassy that she would discuss the January 2010 GICNT 
EPG Meeting with her supervisors, but that she was at this 
point unsure whether the UK would be able to send a 
representative to the meeting.  McDonald cited the ongoing 
CBRN security strategy review, and said the GICNT was a tool 
that would be used as part of the UK's comprehensive security 
strategy.  McDonald also said that resources were scarce and 
that the CBRN security strategy review was working to develop 
goals and priorities against which GICNT and other 
mutilateral partnerships would be measured. 
 
¶2. (SBU) McDonald said that if the UK does not send a 
representative to January's EPG meeting in Budapest, it would 
still make a monetary contribution.  McDonald also cited 
other work that the UK is doing with GICNT, such as 
co-hosting with the U.S. a workshop on detection in March 
¶2010.  She mentioned the possibilty of the UK hosting another 
workshop focusing on exercise planning; these plans are still 
in the early stages, however, and if the workshop did occur 
it would likely not happen until late 2010.
