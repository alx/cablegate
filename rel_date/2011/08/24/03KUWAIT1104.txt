NORTHERN IRAQ - POPULATION DISPLACEMENTS 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  The DART continues to gather information on the 
situation in the Kurdish-controlled region of northern Iraq. 
Since the Government of Iraq closed and mined roads leading 
to this region from the South, there has been no new influx 
of displaced persons.  Populations in the area have moved 
away from frontline communities, and some people are leaving 
and returning to their communities based on changes in 
security reports.  The major concern of people in the region 
is the Turkish military. 
 
¶2.  On 24 March, DART met with a representative from the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  ICRC is 
distributing medical supplies and a small number of tents to 
local authorities in the north for emergency needs.  ICRC is 
targeting prisoners of war, internally displaced persons 
(IDPs), and the sick and wounded. 
 
¶3.  The ICRC delegate confirmed that movements in the 
Kurdish-controlled areas were small compared to recent media 
reports.  He referred to "accordion"-like movements, with 
people moving from their homes to traditional villages or 
small camps and then returning to towns and cities, 
depending on their interpretation of the security situation. 
 
¶4.  UNICEF's Northern Iraq Field Representative provided 
more current information on population movements in northern 
Iraq to the DART.  According to UNICEF, the number of IDPs 
swelled in the days following the onset of the conflict, to 
as many as 600,000, but there was very little traffic toward 
the Turkish or Iranian borders.  Within days the displaced 
returned to their homes.  There are now reported to be 
250,000 to 280,000 IDPs in the north. 
 
¶5.  UNICEF also reported that authorities and aid agencies 
in northern Iraq are prepared for new displacements. 
Eighteen campsites have been identified, and public 
buildings have been identified as collective centers if 
necessary.   UNICEF stocks have been moved to safe areas. 
 
¶6.  On 24 March, Mercy Corps International (MCI) reported 
that people have begun returning to Sulaimaniyah from their 
temporary settlements in the hills.  He said that shops and 
markets in the city are reopening.  MCI also stated that 
there was some concern about IDPs from Dohuk reportedly 
living in inadequate conditions exposed to the elements. 
More current information from Dohuk indicates that some 
people have now returned to their homes but their close 
proximity to Musol, and the Turks, remains a concern.
