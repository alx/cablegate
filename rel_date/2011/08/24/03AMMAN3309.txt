¶1.  Embassy Amman welcomes the visit of an Iraqi MFA 
inspection team to Amman and will be happy to facilitate the 
work of the team, in coordination with the UK Embassy in 
Amman.  Post will name a specific liaison officer for the 
Iraqi MFA team when we have specific travel dates to Amman, 
given the demands on the Embassy to cover upcoming Jordanian 
Parliamentary elections (June 17) and the World Economic 
Forum (Davos) Extraordinary Conference at the Dead Sea (June 
21-13).  In the meantime, CPA should communicate with 
PolCouns Doug Silliman (e-mails - sillimanda@state.gov
