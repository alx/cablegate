SUBJECT:  TF1Z01: EMPOWERMENT, NOT CHARITY: PRESENTING 
          OUR MESSAGE ON HUMANITARIAN AID FOR THE IRAQI 
          PEOPLE 
 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
WE ARE REBUILDING SOCIETY, NOT SUCCOURING THE NEEDY 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶1.  NOW THAT THE BATTLE FOR BAGHDAD IS LARGELY WON, THE 
MAJOR FOCUS OF OUR MESSAGE SHOULD BE THE RESTORATION OF 
ORDER AND RULE OF LAW, THE REBUILDING OF IRAQI 
INSTITUTIONS, AND THE TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY, GRADUAL OR 
OTHERWISE, TO THE IRAQI PEOPLE. AS WE MOVE TO GET FOOD, 
WATER, MEDICINE, AND OTHER ESSENTIAL AID TO THE IRAQI 
POPULATION, THE MESSAGE WE PUT OUT SHOULD FOCUS NOT/NOT 
ON THE FACT THAT WE ARE HELPING THE NEEDY, BUT ON THE 
FACT THAT WE ARE BRINGING FREEDOM AND SECURITY TO THE 
IRAQI POPULATION.  THIS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY IMAGES 
OF OUR DELIVERY OF FOOD, WATER AND MEDICAL AID, BUT THE 
MAIN MESSAGE SHOULD BE ONE OF RECONSTRUCTION, NOT OF 
SUCCOUR OR CHARITY. AS THE PRESIDENT SAID IN BELFAST, 
IRAQIS ARE MORE THAN CAPABLE OF REBUILDING THEIR 
SOCIETY.  WE ARE EMPOWERING THEM AFTER DECADES OF 
DISENFRANCHISEMENT, NOT MINISTERING TO THE WEAK AND 
POWERLESS. OUR INTERLOCUTORS HERE, WHETHER IRAQI, ARAB 
OR EMIRATI, REPEATEDLY REMIND US THAT BY HIGHLIGHTING 
FOOD AID, WE SEND A MESSAGE THAT SHAMES AND HUMILIATES. 
 
 
----------------------------------------- 
DON'T REINFORCE FEELINGS OF POWERLESSNESS 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL REASONS OUR CAMPAIGN TO 
LIBERATE IRAQ HAS PLAYED OUT BADLY IN THE ARAB POPULAR 
MIND IS THAT IT REINFORCES THE FEELINGS, STRONGLY HELD 
HERE AND ELSEWHERE, THAT ARABS ARE WEAK AND BACKWARDS 
VIS-A-VIS THE WEST, THAT THEY ARE THE PAWNS OF GREAT 
POWERS, AND THAT THEY ARE POWERLESS TO DIRECT THEIR 
DESTINIES.  AS WE SHAPE OUR MESSAGE TO THE IRAQI AND 
ARAB PUBLICS DURING THE COMING REBUILDING OF IRAQI 
SOCIETY, WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEND A POTENT 
MESSAGE NOT ONLY THAT AMERICA HAS BROUGHT FREEDOM TO THE 
IRAQIS, BUT ALSO THAT IRAQIS (AND IMPLICITLY ALL ARABS) 
ARE CAPABLE OF BUILDING THEIR OWN FUTURES WHEN GIVEN THE 
OPPORTUNITY.  FOR IRAQIS, ONE OF THE OLDEST AND PROUDEST 
CIVILIZATIONS, WHO HAVE SUFFERED FOR THIRTY YEARS UNDER 
SADDAM, EMPOWERMENT, NOT CHARITY, SHOULD BE OUR MESSAGE. 
NEEDLESS TO SAY, UNLESS THERE IS DEMONSTRABLE PROGRESS 
ON THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN FRONT, ANY MESSAGE WE SEND, 
HOWEVER SKILLFULLY TAILORED, WILL NOT RESONATE WITH THE 
BROADER ARAB PUBLIC.
