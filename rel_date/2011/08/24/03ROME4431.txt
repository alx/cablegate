SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  The food security and nutritional situation in the 
northern and western areas of Cote d'Ivoire has been 
adversely affected by the events of the past year.  The 
lack of civil administration, breakdown in health services, 
and fighting in the west has had a serious negative impact 
on the affected areas.  Even if the peace process and 
demobilization succeed, it will take several months for the 
population to bounce back.  Nicla refugee camp in Guiglo 
now houses 4,140 Liberian refugees and a recent 
registration exercise in Tabou department yielded a total 
of 45,400 refugees.  The U.N. estimates the total number of 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) to be 500,000-600,000. 
There are currently 420 severely malnourished children in 
therapeutic feeding centers in the west and non- 
governmental organizations (NGOs) attribute the nutritional 
problems primarily to the lack of health services, with 
access to food and clean water as the secondary cause.  The 
U.N. World Food Program (WFP) is providing food to 
vulnerable populations through a variety of activities 
suited for specific needs.  Lack of NGO implementing 
partners is a major stumbling block, however.  The upcoming 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the U.N. (FAO) and WFP 
Food and Crop Assessment will help shed light on the 
current national food security situation.  WFP and FAO have 
mounted a successful seeds and tools project targeting 
internally displaced persons and their host communities. 
See para 37 for recommendations.  End Summary.

BACKGROUND

¶2.  Special Assistant to Ambassador Tony Hall, Max Finberg, 
and Senior Emergency Coordinator (SEC) R. Davis in the U.S. 
Mission/Rome visited Cote d'Ivoire September 3-9.  The team 
traveled to the western areas of Guiglo and Tabou September 
4-6, and the SEC followed on with meetings in Abidjan 
through September 9, as Finberg departed Cote d'Ivoire 
after the field travel.  Shane Hough, from State/PRM, also 
joined on the travel.  The purpose of the trip was to gain 
a better understanding of the food security situation in 
the country and its nutritional impact on the population. 
This report discusses these topics, and a second report 
focuses on the plight of third country nationals in the 
west. 
 
¶3.  Up country, the team met with refugees in Nicla refugee 
camp located in Guiglo and refugees and residents in Prollo 
and Tabou near the Liberian border, third country nationals 
(TCNs) housed in Guiglo transit center, and local residents 
and IDPs in a small town (Dahoua) northeast of Guiglo where 
WFP and FAO are implementing a joint agricultural project. RBONCEY,

Meetings were held with the NGO community in the field and 
in Abidjan, UNHCR, UNICEF, FAO, French Cooperation, World 
Bank, the Interagency Humanitarian Coordination Committee 
(IAHCC) Coordinator, French Licorne Force in Guiglo, and 
the local administrations in Guiglo and Tabou. 
 
----------- 
OVERVIEW 
----------- 
 
¶4.  The humanitarian situation in western and northern Cote 
d'Ivoire is unsettling.  On the surface the peace process 
is proceeding, but progress is slow in touching people's 
lives in the western and northern sections of the country. 
The U.N. estimates that 500,000-600,000 persons remain 
displaced and there are over 50,000 refugees.  In the north 
(held by the New Forces for just over one year), neither 
the civil administration nor the banks is functioning; 
therefore, the health system is not operating.  The lack of 
health services alongside a continued decrease in 
purchasing power has had damaging effects on the 
nutritional situation of the general public, and has been 
especially difficult for the children and elderly. 
 
¶5.  In the west, even though the circumstances are 
different, the results are the same but more extreme.  In 
government-held areas of the west, almost all of the civil 
administrators fled due to the fighting that took place 
between October 2002 and May 2003.  Slowly they are 
returning, but there remain many villages where little to 
no civil administration exists.  And there are still areas 
in the west that are considered very dangerous.  Large 
numbers of the work force from the coffee, cocoa, and palm 
oil plantations, primarily composed of third country 
nationals (TCNs), have been chased out.  About 7,000 TCNs, 
seventy percent of whom were Burkinabe, were repatriated to 
Burkina Faso with the help of the International 
Organization for Migration, but thousands also remain 
displaced inside Cote d'Ivoire and prefer to stay, hoping 
to return to their land in Cote d'Ivoire some day.  Issues 
surrounding their protection are also a concern.  (See sep 
tel.) 
 
¶6.  The lack of health services combined with the fact that 
many people lived in the bush for weeks and weeks has 
severely weakened the population in the west.  Even though 
WFP began providing general distributions to the towns it 
could access in March, when greater access was gained in 
late May and June, with the help of the deployment of the 
French Licorne forces, the humanitarian community 
discovered a population in great need of nutritional and 
medical assistance.  Therapeutic feeding centers were 
quickly established in two locations in the west (Guiglo 
and Man) that treated 520 severely malnourished children. 
Three months later the number in the two centers has now 
decreased by only 100 to a total of 420.  The NGOs workingON IN ROME

in nutrition attribute the nutritional problems primarily 
to the lack of health services, with access to food and 
clean water as the secondary cause. 
 
¶7.  Added to this equation is a notable lack of 
international NGOs, insufficient funding, and significant 
numbers of turnover in staff.  Most of the international 
NGOs that are working in the west, which is a handful, 
arrived between April and June.  There are also a few local 
NGOs, but they lack adequate capacity.  The majority of the 
funding comes from private funds, the European Commission, 
and USAID/DCHA/Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance 
(OFDA).  (Note:  In fiscal year 2003, USAID/OFDA provided 
2.4 million USD to four NGOs working in health, nutrition, 
and water/sanitation, and International Committee of the 
Red Cross (ICRC) and UNICEF.  End Note.)  French 
Cooperation said it is providing very little to 
humanitarian assistance; the French contribution is the 
French Licorne forces. 
 
¶8.  School teachers are being paid by the central 
government, whether working or not, but because banks are 
closed in the north, a teacher in the north is required to 
go to the south to cash the check.  Many are scared to go; 
others fled to the south months ago, and now may be scared 
to return to the north once the schools officially re-open. 
In the meantime, some schools are functioning in the north, 
with about two-thirds of the teaching force composed of 
university students unable to attend classes since the 
university in Yamoussoukro is also closed.  To assist the 
teachers, WFP has been providing a one-month ration for one 
person to the teachers in the north.  Schools in the south 
and east are to open October 6.  The ones in the north 
began in January and will continue through October.  They 
will take a two-month break and restart in January. 
 
¶9.  It is the team's conclusion that the humanitarian 
situation in Cote d'Ivoire is at a crossroads.  If the 
peace process progresses positively and demobilization 
begins, the humanitarian situation will improve.  However, 
if the peace process stalls or demobilization does not 
occur within the coming months, then the food security 
situation and health of the general population in the 
affected areas will continue to decline and could become 
quite critical.  Under the best case scenario, it should be 
noted that needs already identified will continue to 
require assistance for the next six to ten months, at a 
minimum, to help people get back on their feet.  The 
humanitarian situation in Cote d'Ivoire merits close 
monitoring.

NICLA REFUGEE CAMP

camp, a camp that has been in existence for over ten years. 
More than 2,000 new refugees arrived in Nicla between June 
and August.  The camp inhabitants are Liberians that have 
resided in Nicla anywhere between a few weeks to over ten 
years.  WFP provides a general food distribution in the 
camp and has changed from giving a monthly ration to 
providing a ration every two weeks because the camp has 
been experiencing a significant combination of new arrivals 
and departures, as many of these refugees are interviewing 
for the U.S. resettlement program.  At the same time, 
Liberians continue to arrive, albeit at a much slower pace 
in the last four weeks since Charles Taylor left Liberia. 
478 arrivals came between August 4-19 and 266 between 
August 20 and September 1.  The recent entries were said to 
have come with very little. 
 
¶11.  The refugees said they were allowed to go to town and 
that they used to have land in the vicinity of the camp on 
which to cultivate.  Since troubles began in Cote d'Ivoire 
last September however, the refugees said the local 
authorities stopped allowing the refugees to farm. 
 
¶12.  The team witnessed a food distribution taking place 
under the management of Caritas, WFP's implementing 
partner, one of only two NGOs (both local) working in the 
camp.  The daily ration provided for two weeks was composed 
of 250 grams (gm) rice, 200 gm maize meal, 30 gm vegetable 
oil, and 5 gm salt.  Beans and corn-soy blend (CSB) were 
missing from the ration because of WFP's pipeline break. 
The distribution seemed to be well organized and was 
overseen by members of the Cote d'Ivoire armed forces 
(FANCI).  Absent, however, was food basket monitoring which 
should be done when beneficiaries exit the distribution 
site, and post-distribution monitoring (PDM), which should 
occur two weeks after the distribution.  Just recently, 
WFP's food monitors began PDM, but WFP/CI does not have 
adequate staff to do a thorough job of PDM.  An NGO should 
have the task. 
 
¶13.  In addition, the prefet of Guiglo stated that there 
were 12,000 IDPs in his department--not living in camps. 
 
------------- 
TABOU AREA 
------------- 
 
¶14.  Fighting in the extreme southwest began in January 
2003 but remained about 80 km north of Tabou town, which is 
located on the ocean and about 30 km from the Liberian 
border.  Tabou department is composed of 132 villages with 
a population of approximately 137,000 (excluding refugees). 
The area around Tabou traditionally had few services.  For 
example, there is only one hour of water every two days in 
Tabou town.  The French Licorne forces had maintained a 
base in Tabou since January, but closed it and moved to San 
Pedro, 100 kms. east along the coast, in late August, asR POL; USAID FOR

they said the security situation had greatly improved.  The 
area between Tai and Grabo, 60 kms. north of Tabou, became 
accessible only in the last month. 
 
¶15.  WFP opened a sub-office in Tabou in May as the influx 
of refugees from Liberia began to grow.  UNHCR conducted a 
registration exercise August 30-September 1 which resulted 
in a count of 45,402 refugees, and all agree that the 
figure is pretty reliable.  The vast majority of the 
refugees live with hosting families, with only about 4,000 
living in the transit center in Tabou town.  The refugees 
in the transit center receive three hot meals a day rather 
than dry rations.  WFP wants to maintain this practice to 
reinforce the temporary nature of the camp. 
 
¶16.  In early July, the International Rescue Committee 
(IRC) arrived in the area and began assisting with mobile 
medical clinics and water/sanitation in surrounding 
villages.  Oxfam just began working in the area, also doing 
health and water/sanitation in villages hosting refugees. 
There is currently no NGO in this area focused on 
nutrition. 
 
¶17.  Caritas serves as WFP's implementing partner for food 
distributions in Tabou department.  Caritas has conducted 
two general distributions (one in June and second in late 
July) to the refugees in the Tabou area, but WFP is likely 
to change to only targeted distributions to the most 
vulnerable in the future via supplementary feeding and 
school feeding for the host populations, IDPs, and refugees 
alike, which the team supports.  WFP has also recently 
formed a registration and distribution team that is 
composed of six individuals and has also recruited two food 
aid monitors locally. 
 
¶18.  Oxfam conducted a food security assessment of the 
Tabou area in June, but could not access the area between 
Grabo and Tai, 120 kms. to the north, at the time.  The 
mission found no emergency situation, but noted constraints 
in the household due to lack of cash and access to land to 
grow food.  Oxfam is fielding another food security mission 
to Tabou in October. 
 
¶19.  Populations in Tabou department have doubled, and in 
some cases, tripled in size.  Even though the locals and 
the refugees are getting along well thus far, there is 
concern about overstretching the communities to share very 
limited supplies of food and water and health and 
sanitation services.  Thus the work of the NGOs in these 
areas is important to addressing potential tensions. 
 
¶20.  Very near Tabou is the PALMCI company producing palm 
oil.  PALMCI had employed many TCNs, but now finds itself 
lacking much of its workforce.  UNHCR had met with PALMCI 
just before the team's visit and reported that PALMCI was 
very willing to temporarily hire the refugees as it had 900N FOR REFUGEE

WET FEEDING FOR CHILREN 
------------------------- 
 
¶21.  In addition to providing wet meals to the children in 
the Nicla transit camp (reported in sep tel), Solidarites 
is also providing wet meals five days a week to children 
five years and younger and mothers in Toulepleu (4,500), 
Duekoue (355), and Daloa (1,060).  The meals are provided 
in the early morning and at noon.  In between the meals, 
the children stay at the feeding point and play games.  In 
Toulepleu, Solidarites is feeding all children in the 
village, including IDP, refugee, and host family children. 
With four feeding centers in Toulepleu, Solidarites began 
with feeding 3,500 children, but quickly realized there 
were many more in need.  It is now at 4,500 and stated it 
would probably increase to 5,000 if WFP had sufficient food 
stocks to support the program.  Soldiarites's funding stops 
at the end of September, but it hopes that it can continue 
its wet feeding to the children at least through October, 
as IDPs are returning to the villages around Toulepleu. 
(Comment:  Solidarites is providing a valuable service 
within this western area of Cote d'Ivoire.  If they stop 
their current projects, the negative impact on the children 
could be quite acute.  End Comment.) 
 
------------- 
MALNUTRITION 
------------- 
 
¶22.  In June, as humanitarian organizations began to have 
access to areas in the west, it was apparent that special 
nutritional interventions were critical.  Medecins Sans 
Frontieres (MSF) France opened a therapeutic feeding center 
(TFC) in Guiglo and MSF/Belgium opened a TFC in Man 
targeting severely malnourished children five years and 
younger (less than 70 percent weight for height). 
Initially, there were about 200 children in the Guiglo TFC 
and 320 in Man.  The caseload in Guiglo's TFC has now 
lowered to 130 patients, but the center in Man has 
maintained an average of 300 patients, ranging from 260 to 
320 patients at any one time.  On September 8, there were 
289 children in the Man TFC.  MSF/France reports that it 
continues to receive patients that have been hiding in the 
bush and that the majority of malnourishment is in the form 
of kwashiorkor, reflecting a lack of protein in the diet. 
 
¶23.  MSF/Holland is working in the Danane area with ten 
internationals living in Danane.  It operates mobile 
clinics, works in the Danane hospital, and sees 200-300 
patients a day.  It refers cases of severe malnutrition to 
MSF/B's TFC in Man.  MSF/B is considering also opening a 
TFC in Korhogo.SAID FOR AADAMS, RBONCEY, DATTEBERRY

¶24.  Action Contre La Faim (ACF), which began working in 
Bouake last October, operates ten supplementary feeding 
centers (for moderately malnourished children):  five in 
government-controlled areas and five in rebel-held 
territories.  Their centers in Duekoue, Man, and Guiglo 
complement the TFCs run by MSF. 
 
¶25.  Remembering Burundi in 1997, when many, many adults 
hid in the forest for months and emerged in an extremely 
fragile condition, the SEC asked MSF if it had seen 
severely malnourished adults.  The answer was affirmative. 
Adults are often not treated for malnourishment as the 
focus is usually on children, unless the numbers become 
overwhelming as they did in Burundi.  The fact that there 
are severely malnourished adults in a country such as Cote 
d'Ivoire is a worrying sign. 
 
------------------------- 
LACK OF HEALTH SERVICES 
------------------------- 
 
¶26.  The area north of Guiglo to Man, west to Danane and 
south to Toulepleu forms a square of territory that is 
quite delicate.  The MSFs and Merlin are operating mobile 
clinics to treat health problems and identify malnutrition, 
but they report it is not enough.  Besides ICRC, the MSFs, 
Solidarites, and Merlin are the only NGOs working in this 
area, as the security situation remains tenuous.  Guiglo is 
a government-held area but going north to Man or west to 
Danane crosses into New Forces-held terrain.  MSF reported 
that some IDPs are returning to the area, but they have 
lost most of their assets and their purchasing power is 
very low. 
 
¶27.  As reported in para 6 above, the MSFs report that the 
primary culprit behind the malnutrition levels is 
morbidity, related to the current lack of health services 
in the west and north.  Services in the west were suspended 
because of insecurity and all civil administration in the 
north came to a standstill after September19 last year. 
Services in the north have never reumed, and the west 
remains too insecure for mosthealth workers.

FOOD SECURITY 
--------------- 
 
¶28.  Cote d'Ivoire is a largecountry with a variety of 
cash crops.  It is theleading cocoa producer in the world, 
holding 43 prcent of the world market.  It is also a major 
cffee producer and in the south, large plantations f oil 
palms, rubber trees, banana and pineapple xist.  In the 
eastern zone between rain forest ad savanna, cashew 
plantations are gradually replaing the declining the cocoa 
plantations.  The north produces about two-thirds of the 
sugar needs of the country, and cotton is the north's most

¶29.  With this as a backdrop, it is difficult to grasp the 
fact that there could be food security problems and severe 
malnourishment in Cote d'Ivoire.  As stated above, the 
displacement caused by the fighting from October to May 
coupled with the breakdown in social services has led to a 
decline in basic food production, in purchasing power, and 
in the general health of the population in the affected 
zones.  Some food security assessments have been performed 
by NGOs, but analysis is lacking and there is no U.N. 
agency serving as an overall coordinator for fielding the 
assessments or the methodology employed. 
 
¶30.  In May, WFP established a food security working group 
headed by a staff member dedicated to tracking the food 
security situation.  WFP has sent a proposal to various 
donors for the establishment of a Risk and Food Security 
Monitoring System (355,000 USD for one year), but thus far 
has received no funds.  The unit would collect and provide 
information on the economic, social, health, and political 
factors affecting food security in coordination with the 
government, U.N. agencies, and NGOs.  In addition, the unit 
would coordinate data collection and analysis which would 
serve as a guide for interventions.  Such work is vital for 
the continued monitoring and understanding of the food 
security situation in Cote d'Ivoire.   Also, an FAO and WFP 
Crop and Food Assessment will be conducted at the end of 
October which will greatly help in gaining an overall 
understanding of the situation, as we currently have no 
national picture.

FAO AND WFP WORKING TOGETHER 
------------------------------ 
 
¶31.  The team was very pleased to see a joint FAO/WFP 
project being implemented in several areas of the north and 
west.  WFP included in its Emergency Operation (EMOP) a 
budget for agriculture tools, fertilizer, and pesticides, 
and FAO purchased the seeds.  In addition, WFP provides a 
cereal ration to serve as seed protection for the family. 
Seeds and tools were provided in April/May to 5,381 
households in the departments of Korhogo, Sakassou, 
Yamoussoukro, Tiebissou, and Bouake.  And now in September, 
9,500 households are being assisted in the departments of 
Tabou, Duekoue, Guiglo, Toulepleu, Man, Danane, Zouan- 
Hounien, and Bin Houye.  These are areas where there are 
high concentrations of IDPs, and the project targets host 
families and IDPs.  FAO wanted to provide even more seeds, 
as the demand for them has grown as people return home, but 
did not have sufficient quantities to meet the growing 
demand.  WFP and FAO are planning another distribution in 
the north for February.  The team met with beneficiaries of 
the agricultural inputs in the town of Dahoua, a fewS. MISSION IN ROME

1,326 and has taken in 586 IDPs.  The residents and IDPs 
were clearing land for rice production and were very 
grateful about the assistance being provided.

WFP OPERATIONS 
---------------- 
 
¶32.  Late last October, WFP replaced its Cote d'Ivoire 
country director who was overseeing WFP's development 
programs with one of its best emergency managers, Gemmo 
Lodesani.  As the war unfolded, first in the north and then 
in the west, WFP moved as quickly as access allowed to 
respond to the growing needs.  WFP opened seven sub- 
offices, in addition to the sub-office that already existed 
in the east in Bondoukou.  Each sub-office is responding to 
the needs in a variety of ways which include general 
distributions, supplementary feeding, emergency school 
feeding, wet meals to children, food-for-work, and seed 
protection.  Given the lack of implementing partners (IPs) 
and problems with securing funding, WFP is to be 
congratulated for its significant efforts in addressing the 
burgeoning needs in the country over the last year. 
 
¶33.  The lack of IPs for WFP remains a critical gap and is 
directly related to the overall lack of international NGOs 
in the country.  There are a few local NGOs, but they lack 
adequate capacity.  The lack of IPs impacts not only the 
quality of WFP programs, themselves, but also the post- 
distribution monitoring of the programs.  Where there are 
no IPs, WFP staff are performing the tasks, but WFP does 
not have sufficient numbers of staff to implement these 
programs properly.  WFP needs a strong NGO partner for its 
programs in the north and the west.  Below is listed where 
WFP has or does not have IPs for its programs.  The list 
very well highlights the small number of active NGOs. 
 
Abidjan:  Caritas and GTZ (distribution to refugees) 
 
Guiglo: Caritas and Solidarites for general distributions 
and wet feeding.  MSF/F, ACF, and Merlin for special 
feeding programs. 
 
Man:  WFP is doing all its own general distributions. 
MSF/F, MSF/H, ICRC, and ACF for special feeding programs. 
 
Tabou:  Caritas for general distributions.  ACF for special 
feeding programs. 
 
Daloa:  Solidarites 
 
Yamoussoukro:  WFP does not have an NGO partner here; 
rather its implementing partners are national associations 
(ASAPSU, Soeurs Providence and Centre Remar).  IRC and 
Caritas are present however.M U.S. MISSION IN ROME

WFP FOOD PIPELINE 
------------------- 
 
¶34.  For the last several weeks, WFP has been experiencing 
pipeline problems which will continue into October.  Even 
though WFP has received significant pledges from 
USAID/DCHA/Office of Food for Peace (FFP) (6.2 million USD) 
and the European Union (5.8 million USD), the U.S. 
commodities will not begin arriving until late September 
and October.  WFP is unsure of the arrival dates of the EU 
commodities.  To cover the breaks, WFP made local 
purchases, most of which were purchased inside Cote 
d'Ivoire. 
 
¶35.  Looking to 2004, WFP has begun preparing its next EMOP 
that would begin in January.  A joint mission is being 
prepared with UNHCR and donors for mid-October that will 
serve as a platform for discussion for the kinds of 
activities to be included in the 2004 EMOP.  WFP then hopes 
to issue the EMOP in late November so that donor 
contributions could be pledged immediately to allow for 
shipments to begin arriving in March 2004.  The current 
pipeline reflects a need for pulses in April as the most 
urgent requirement.

PARTING SHOT - A RAY OF HOPE 
------------------------------ 
 
¶36.  While in Dahoua, the team met with the townspeople and 
the IDPs.  The team thanked the village chief for taking in 
such a large number of IDPs and being so hospitable (IDPs 
increased the size of the village by 45 percent).  The 
chief responded by saying that he had been a teacher in the 
village and many of the townspeople had been his students. 
He said he had taught them as students to welcome 
strangers, and Dahoua had become a village where others 
knew they were welcome.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
----------------- 
 
¶37.  The team makes the following recommendations: 
 
-  FAO should work with the local authorities to provide 
land once again to the Nicla refugee camp inhabitants if 
they remain in the camp for the next planting season.R

-  WFP should implement post-distribution monitoring in the 
Nicla refugee camp immediately and needs an implementing 
partner for this. 
 
-  The nutritional needs in the Tabou department need to be 
assessed.  Again, the lack of a nutritional NGO in that 
area is a drawback. 
 
-- Food and non-food interventions in Tabou department 
should be supported in the short term to lower any 
potential tensions between the local hosting families and 
the 45,400 refugees as they vie for the same limited 
resources. 
 
-  USAID/DCHA/OFDA should consider providing funding 
Solidarites if it does not receive funding from ECHO.  As 
stated in para 21 above, if Solidarites stops its 
operations at the end of September, it will cause a huge 
gap in providing wet meals to large numbers of children 
five years and younger in the west. 
 
-  USAID/DCHA/OFDA should also consider providing funding 
to WFP in support of its Risk and Food Security Monitoring 
System, as such an effort for food security is sorely 
needed.  175,000 USD would provide six months of funding. 
 
-  WFP needs additional implementing partners.  Donors, 
especially the U.S. and the EU since they are providing the 
bulk of commodities to WFP, should collaborate with WFP in 
finding suitable partners. 
 
-  USAID/DCHA/FFP should participate in the joint UNHCR- 
WFP-donor mission that will discuss activities and 
strategies for the 2004 EMOP.  The dates are October 14-24, 
¶2003.
