SUBJECT:  SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST PART OF MEDIA 
CONTROL LAW 
 
  ¶1.   On May 8 the Zimbabwe Supreme Court ruled that 
      Section 80 of the controversial Access to Information 
      and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) is 
      unconstitutional and invalidated that section of the 
      Act.  Section 80 made the publication of a 
      "falsehoods" a criminal offense.  In testimony before 
      the ruling, the government's lawyer conceded that 
      Section 80 was vaguely worded and could be interpreted 
      so broadly that it would conflict with 
      constitutionally guaranteed freedom of expression. 
 
  ¶2.   Information Minister Jonathan Moyo has stated 
      that he will present a revised Section 80 to 
      Parliament for passage and enactment.
