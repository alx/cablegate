SUBJECT: PERSONAL PROTECTION REQUEST FOR SPANISH 
ANTI-TERRORISM JUDGE D. BALTASAR GARZON REAL 
 
¶1.  (SBU) RSO has received a letter from the Spanish Ministry 
of Interior, Secretary of State for Security, requesting that 
the Diplomatic Security Service provide protective security 
services for Spanish Anti-Terrorism Judge Baltasar Garzon. 
Judge Garzon will be a long-term guest lecturer at New York 
University's King Juan Carlos Center for nine months from 
February 28, 2005 until December 01, 2005.  His classes will 
deal with terrorism and national security issues. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Judge Garzon is considered a critical threat 
profile Judge due to his on-going oversight and involvement 
in highly-visible terrorism cases including the September 11, 
2001 Trade Tower bombings as connected to the Moroccan 
Al-Qaida cell known as the Barakat Yarkas group. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In the letter received, the Spanish Secretary of 
State for Security highlights what they consider to be the 
risks and considerations that come with the public exposure 
of Judge Garzon's work in New York City and requests a 
permanent security presence for him.  The GOS is committed to 
provide two armed Spanish Police to Judge Garzon full time 
but believe that a U.S. law enforcement presence is essential 
for coordination and effectiveness. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In discussions on February 11 with the Spanish 
Police Chief for Protective Service, Angel Quintana, the RSO 
explained that due to extreme demand on DSS manpower, it was 
unlikely that 2 DSS Agents could be provided full time, and 
that it was also unlikely that even a single agent could be 
dedicated for nine months to this detail.  The RSO opined 
that the more likely scenario would be an accessible agent 
for coordination, communication and problem solving out of DP 
or PL. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Due to the limited planning time (February 28 
departure), RSO requests urgent consideration be given to 
this request with a rapid response to the RSO for the Spanish 
Protective Police travel and visa requirement planning, 
keeping the Spanish Embassy in Washington and the Spanish 
Consulate in New York in the loop.
