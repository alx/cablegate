SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  (U) DURING HIS WEEKLY WEDNESDAY AUDIENCE IN ST. PETER'S 
SQUARE APRIL 9, POPE JOHN PAUL II URGED THE WORLD TO NOT 
    FORGET THE VIOLENT AND CONTINUING CONFLICT IN THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION OF AFRICA, AND CALLED ON LEADERS TO RETURN TO THE 
PEACE PROCESS.  VATICAN OFFICIALS HAD PASSED EMBASSY A 
PRO-MEMORIA ON MARCH 24 SEEKING U.S. SUPPORT IN STOPPING THE 
VIOLENCE IN THE ITURI REGION OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF 
CONGO AND MAKING PROGRESS IN THE PEACE PROCESS (REFTEL).  IN 
THE FACE OF CONTINUING INTERNATIONAL FOCUS ON IRAQ, THE POPE 
SOUGHT TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE CRISIS IN AFRICA -- A POINT 
HE REITERATED IN HIS APRIL 20 EASTER MESSAGE.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (U) ADDRESSING A GENERAL AUDIENCE APRIL 6 ON THE GREAT 
LAKES CONFLICT, POPE JOHN PAUL II DIRECTED "A HEARTFELT 
APPEAL TO THE POLITICIANS IN CHARGE, AS WELL AS TO ALL MEN 
AND WOMEN OF GOOD WILL, SO THAT THEY COMMIT THEMSELVES TO 
BRING AN END TO THE VIOLENCE AND ABUSE, PUTTING ASIDE 
PERSONAL SELFISHNESS AND GROUP INTERESTS, WITH THE ACTIVE 
COLLABORATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY."  THE POPE WAS 
RESPONDING TO REPORTS OF APRIL 6 FROM THE U.N. MISSION IN THE 
CONGO THAT AROUND 1,000 PEOPLE DIED THE WEEK BEFORE IN WHAT 
APPEARED TO BE ETHNIC MASSACRES, INCLUDING SUMMARY 
EXECUTIONS.  RECOGNIZING THAT THIS VIOLENCE BROUGHT WITH IT 
THE POTENTIAL TO REIGNITE MASSIVE ARMED CONFLICT IN THE 
REGION, THE POPE URGED THAT "EVERY EFFORT AT RECONCILIATION 
AMONG THE CONGOLESE, UGANDAN AND RWANDAN PEOPLES MUST BE 
ENCOURAGED...WITH THE HOPE THAT FROM THESE EFFORTS PEACE 
WHICH IS SO DESIRED, CAN FLOWER." 
 
¶3.  (U) IN HIS EASTER MESSAGE, THE POPE FOLLOWED HIS CALL FOR 
PEACE IN IRAQ WITH A CALL FOR "PEACE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE 
WORLD, WHERE FORGOTTEN WARS AND PROTRACTED HOSTILITIES ARE 
CAUSING DEATHS AND INJURIES AMID SILENCE AND NEGLECT ON THE 
    PART OF CONSIDERABLE SECTORS OF PUBLIC OPINION."  HE 
CAUTIONED THAT THE AFRICAN CONTINENT "CANNOT BE ABANDONED TO 
ITSELF."

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) THE VATICAN IS DEEPLY WORRIED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL 
FOR RENEWED VIOLENCE IN AN ALREADY DEVASTATED REGION.  ADDING 
TO THE POPE'S WORRIES IS THE FEAR THAT THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS 
TAKEN FOCUS AWAY FROM THE VIOLENT CONFLICT IN AFRICA, AND 
THAT WITHOUT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY'S COLLABORATION, A 
TENUOUS PEACE WILL REVERT TO FURTHER ETHNIC SLAUGHTER.  THE 
POPE'S STRONG PUBLIC STATEMENT REFLECTS THE HOLY SEE'S 
CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR PEACE IN THE REGION, AND ITS DESIRE TO 
ENSURE THIS CRISIS IS NOT FORGOTTEN IN THE GLOBAL FOCUS ON 
IRAQ.
