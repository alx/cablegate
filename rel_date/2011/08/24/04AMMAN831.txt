Jordanian instruction. Additionally several senior officers and 
pilots are being trained by the Jordanians. This training is 
being conducted at several Jordanian bases in Zarqa, Madaba, and 
Mafraq. The candidates at Zarqa have moved into their recently 
constructed quarters. The Jordanian military has been most 
cooperative. CMATT (Coalition Military Assistance Training Team)

Iraqi Interim Travel Documents 
------------------------------ 
¶2. Iraqi Consul in Amman told PolOff on January 14 that his 
consular staff had received authority to start extending Iraqi 
passports, issuing Interim Travel Documents (ITDs) and performing 
notary services.  He said that at present, only the U.S., U.K., 
India, Egypt and Jordan, are accepting the ITD as an official 
travel document.  He urged the U.S. government to assist in 
convincing more countries to accept the ITD as a substitute for 
an Iraqi passport.   The Consul added that Iraqis in Jordan 
continually ask his staff when the Embassy will be authorized to 
issue new Iraqi passports.

Japanese diplomats have approached the Jordanian Ministry of 
Planning, as well as representatives of the Iraqi Ministries of 
Trade and Health who were in Amman attending meetings with the

building and training programs for Iraqis, but groups of Iraqis
