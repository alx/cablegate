SUBJECT: PRT LASHKAR GAH, HELMAND PROVINCE: GOVERNOR MANGAL TAKES 
CHARGE 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Governor Mangal's first two months in Helmand 
have been productive, building solid support for his administration. 
 His public outreach efforts are excellent, and he continues to meet 
regularly with residents of Lashkar Gah and the tribal and civil 
leadership of Helmand.  Mangal has an impressive understanding of 
government operations and is pushing his provincial ministry 
directors to improve their planning and implementation capacity and 
to take charge of reconstruction and development efforts.  He has an 
effective working relationship with the British-led Provincial 
Reconstruction Team (PRT), and Afghan security forces have responded 
well to his leadership.  During a May 24 dinner, which included 
senior Afghan government officials, visiting British Secretary of 
State for Defense Des Browne registered HMG's strong support for the 
Helmand governor.  Mangal's experience and determination to improve 
Helmand's provincial government sends a strong signal to area 
residents that the Afghan government can be effective. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Upon his arrival in Helmand, Governor Mangal immediately 
focused on improving the performance of the provincial government. 
He has pushed provincial ministry directors to improve their 
operations and is personally reviewing the capacity of each 
director.  Mangal chaired his first Helmand Provincial Development 
Committee on May 20 and was not pleased with the directors' reports. 
 He told the directors to coordinate all government, NGO and 
international development activities within their areas of 
responsibility.  The fight against corruption is a primary goal of 
his administration; he called for their support in eliminating it. 
Mangal told PRT officers that some local officials enjoy political 
or family connections and their removal from office will be 
difficult; however, with sufficient proof of non-performance, 
changes can be made in Helmand's provincial government. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Public outreach is a key part of Mangal's efforts to bring 
the government closer to the people.  He makes a point of traveling 
around Lashkar Gah and makes regular visits to the city bazaars to 
speak with the merchants and shoppers.  In conjunction with the 
Ministry of Information and Culture, he organized a Public Poetry 
Festival in Lashkar Gah on May 15.  The event took place at the 
women's park with several thousand people in attendance.  Mangal 
delivered the opening address and called upon the audience to help 
promote a better image of Helmand, and to work with him to attract 
business, visitors and investments to the province.  Residents were 
pleased by this effort and Mangal's support among the populace is 
growing. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mangal has established an effective relationship with the 
PRT, which has provided him with expanded internet service, 
computers and office furniture to improve his office's capacity. 
Mangal told the PRT additional investment in government 
infrastructure is required in Lashkar Gah and the District Centers 
to reestablish the government across Helmand.  His relationship with 
the security leadership is good, and he participates in weekly 
security briefings from Afghan and UK security forces.  He 
occasionally maintains longer office hours to meet additional guests 
and build better ties across the province. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Mangal's first two months in Helmand have been impressive. 
The provincial government is coming to life and he is pushing 
ministry directors to produce results.  Residents of Lashkar Gah 
readily express support for Mangal and his efforts and have high 
hopes he can continue to improve the functions of Helmand's 
government.
