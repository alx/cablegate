¶1. (U) This is an Action Request, (Para 3). 
 
¶2. (U) On May 5, Pol/Econoff delivered reftel demarches on 
Fanta and Sauces to Yemen Customs Chairman Hafez F. Mayiad. 
Mayiad told pol/econoff that he would support the USG 
position on  Fanta Beverage Base (REF A) at the upcoming 
Harmonized System Committee meetings in Brussels.  However, 
he has yet to take a position on the classification of Sauces 
(REF B).  Mayiad explained that his agency must examine the 
effect of this issue on Yemeni farmers who produce and export 
a wide variety of processed vegetables and sauces. After 
consulting with the Ministry of Finance, he will give us the 
ROYG decision. 
 
¶3. (U) Action Request: Please provide Arabic translations of 
the demarches as soon as possible to pol/econoff Jill
