SUMMARY 
------- 
¶1.  On 25 March, the Health Fusion Cell met with 
representatives in water and sanitation, civil governance, 
and OTI to strategize on health and water assessments, 
funding capabilities, and interventions.  CA assessments 
have begun in Safwan to determine the condition of the 5,000 
people who are in need of water.  Meanwhile a Kuwaiti Red 
Crescent Society convoy of seven trucks departed for Umm 
Qasr on 26 March, and a water pipeline between the Kuwaiti 
border and Umm Qasr is being constructed to supply 
desalinated water to the port town.  The British ship, Sir 
Galahad, loaded with 232,300 kilograms of emergency 
humanitarian supplies is ready to unload at Umm Qasr, while 
a ship carrying Australian wheat will wait at the UAE until 
the port is deemed secure.  The DART conducted an assessment 
of the Port of Umm Qasr on 26 March, and initial reports 
suggest that security is acceptable for more detailed 
assessment teams to move into the port area.  On 25 March, 
the DART met with two representatives from IOM to discuss 
coordination and IDPs assistance in southern Iraq. 
¶2.  ORHA has requested that all USAID team members working 
directly with ORHA go through the CONUS Resupply Center and 
that all U.S. Contractors entering Iraq have protective 
equipment.  On 26 March, USAID Mission Staff will 
participate in an ORHA meeting with a tribal leader of 
Basra.  ORHA has also scheduled a meeting regarding liaison 
issues with Iraqi Ministries.  End Summary.

¶3.  One of the two ships carrying Australian wheat has moved 
from Muscat, Oman to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  The 
Australian Embassy has announced that the Government of 
Australia (GOA) is still in negotiations with the Australian 
Wheat Board over the price of the 100,000 metric tons (MT) 
of wheat, which comprises the two shipments.  A final price 
will be determined once the issue of payment of associated 
transport costs is settled.  The estimated cost of the wheat 
is 20 million USD; associated transport costs are estimated 
at 24 million USD.  However, because of the time it is 
taking to resolve the issue of transport costs, which is 
necessary for any World Food Program (WFP) in-kind donation, 
the Australian Wheat Board has stated that the wheat could 
be sold on the commercial market in Oman or UAE within the 
next 36 hours.

HEALTH

¶4.  On 25 March, the Health Fusion Cell met with 
representatives in water and sanitation, civil governance, 
and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) to strategize 
on health and water assessments, funding capabilities, and 
interventions.  The Health Fusion Cell will incorporate the 
water and sanitation team.  The meeting addressed early 
interventions, longer-term reconstruction, and interim 
capabilities to restore water infrastructure.  Regular 
ministry support meetings are also occurring, including the 
Ministry of Health, to ensure immediate support and 
functioning of the ministries once there is a regime change.

HUMANITARIAN OPERATION CENTER (HOC) DAILY BRIEFING 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  According to a Kuwaiti government representative, a 
Kuwaiti Red Crescent Society convoy of seven trucks departed 
for Umm Qasr on 26 March.  Each truck is transporting 
approximately 25 MT of rice, bread, lentils, sugar, 
vegetable oil, tea, canned goods, dairy products, fruit 
juices, and bottled water.  The relief supplies are being 
warehoused at the port and distribution will be undertaken 
by U.K. military personnel.  Daily convoys are expected to 
continue to bring additional relief supplies to the 
population of Umm Qasr. 
¶6.  A water pipeline between the Kuwaiti border and Umm Qasr 
is being constructed to provide 2.4 million liters of 
desalinated water per day from the main Kuwaiti water system 
to the port town.  The Government of Kuwait is funding the 
pipeline, and construction assistance has been provided by 
the U.S. Corps of Engineers.  The pipeline is expected to be 
operational on or about 30 March. 
¶7.  The British ship, Sir Galahad, loaded with 232,300 
kilograms of emergency food, water, medical supplies, and 
blankets is ready to unload in Umm Qasr.  Assessment of the 
Umm Qasr channel continues and once the port is ready the 
ship will be off-loaded.  Two cranes at the port were 
assessed to be operational. 
¶8.  Humanitarian assessments have begun in Safwan to 
determine the condition of the 5,000 people who are in need 
of water but not requesting food.  Those affected are still 
in their homes and speculation is that the water supply has 
been disrupted. 
 
---------------- 
NGO COORDINATION 
---------------- 
 
¶9.  On 25 March, the DART met with two representatives from 
the International Organization for Migration (IOM), who will 
be based in southern Iraq, to discuss WFP/IOM coordination 
and IOM's plans to assist IDPs in their area.  IOM plans to 
establish an integrated network of NGOs to assist and 
protect IDPs in Iraq in conjunction with WFP.  The IOM has 
not yet propositioned large amounts of non-food items yet 
but plans to begin procuring relief supplies now that they 
are receiving contributions to the Flash Appeal.  As soon as 
the U.N. Security Coordinator (UNSECOORD) determines that 
the situation is stable, IOM plans to shift operations from 
Kuwait City to Basra, where it would be co-located with the 
UN Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq and other 
U.N. agencies and international organizations.

MILITARY LIAISON UNIT 
-------------------- 
 
¶10.  The DART conducted an initial assessment of the Port of 
Umm Qasr on 26 March.  The Assessment Team was comprised of 
security, communications, and military liaison officers and 
a specialist in chemical, biological, and nuclear exposure. 
Initial reports suggest that security is acceptable for more 
detailed assessment teams to move into the port area. 
 
¶11.  The Assessment Team identified a large quantity of 
warehouse space available at the port.  Water and 
electricity have been cut off due to disruptions in the 
system at Basra.  The Assessment Team will make initial 
recommendations on how to restore emergency power and water 
distribution. 
 
-------------------- 
USAID - RECONSTRUCTION 
-------------------- 
 
¶12. The Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance 
(ORHA) has requested that all USAID team members working 
directly with ORHA must go through the CONUS RESUPPLY CENTER 
at Fort Benning, which is the personnel liaison for the U.S. 
military.  CRC will insure that training, DOD travel orders 
(required for deployment to Iraq), equipment, shots, and 
transportation are covered for all ORHA staff. 
¶13.  ORHA has requested that all U.S. Contractors who will 
be entering Iraq have the following equipment: gas masks, 
Kevlar helmet, Kevlar vest, appropriate shots, and CBNE 
gear.  The Mission will coordinate with ORHA on how long 
this requirement will be in place. 
¶14.  The Public Affairs Team organized a press roundtable 
with the DART on 26 March.  They have asked the USAID 
Mission Director to plan a press roundtable on 
reconstruction in the near future.  Also on 26 March, USAID 
Mission Staff will participate in an ORHA meeting with a 
major tribal leader of Basra in order to better understand 
Basra's local governance structures. 
¶15.  A Concept of Operations information briefing will occur 
on 28 March with all ORHA Functional Coordinators.  During 
the briefing, the USAID Reconstruction Team will present its 
concept of operations to ORHA main staff. 
¶16. On 29 March, ORHA has scheduled an all-day meeting 
regarding liaison with Iraqi Ministries.  USAID Mission team 
members will attend as appropriate.  The meeting will 
produce a general guidance and briefing plan for ORHA.  A 
policy advisor nominated by DOD will arrive to work with the 
Ministry liaisons.  ORHA has agreed to provide 
translator/interpreter support for the USAID Reconstruction 
Team.
