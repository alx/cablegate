     ¶B. AMMAN 1252 
 
¶1.  (u)  On March 13, Embassy informed Petrofac Business 
Development Manager Brock Tuppeny of the USG's determination 
that Petrofac's bid on the Iraq-Zarqa pipeline project would 
not qualify for advocacy support (ref a).  We cited USG 
concerns over the Iraq portion of the project and possible US 
and UN sanctions violations inherent in the project as key 
reasons for denying advocacy. We offered to re-examine the 
request in the event of changes to the RFP or to the 
sanctions regimes on Iraq.
