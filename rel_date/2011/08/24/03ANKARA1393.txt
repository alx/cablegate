SUBJECT: THE GLOBE PROGRAM: TURKEY'S VIEWS 
 
REF. SECSTATE 6351 
 
 
¶1.  Embassy met with GLOBE national coordinator Fatma Baykal 
2/7 to explore ways to energize program activities.  Baykal 
advised that despite great interest in the program, the 
Ministry of National Education (MONE) is no longer able to 
implement the program as fully as it would like. Baykal 
advised, for example, that Turkey lost out on participating 
in the successful IT Hasan grant proposal, a four-country 
GLOBE project with Egypt, Jordan, Lebannon and Turkey, 
because the GOT was unable to respond to its partners in a 
timely fashion. 
 
 
¶2.  MONE has recommended that TUBITAK (the Scientific and 
Research Council of Turkey) assume all national GLOBE 
responsibilities and has asked embassy to facilitate a 
smooth transition. TUBITAK has not yet responded to the MONE 
request. 
 
 
¶3.  Comment. Turkey was one of the early signers of the 
GLOBE agreement (May 1995) but has allowed the program to 
slow considerably since an enthusiastic start. TUBITAK's 
GLOBE leadership has alluring possibilities but may be 
fraught with bureaucratic obstacles.  Post will meet again 
with MONE, confer with TUBITAK and advise on which agency is 
likely to become party to the new NASA agreement.
