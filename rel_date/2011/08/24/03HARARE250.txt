SUBJECT: TWO JOURNALISTS ARRESTED AT TSVANGIRAI TRIAL, 
OTHERS BARRED 
 
  ¶1.   Two journalists were arrested outside of 
Harare's High Court on February 3 as they sought 
entrance into the court to cover the opening day of 
opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai's treason trial. 
The two journalists, Daily News Deputy News Editor 
Pedzisayi Ruhanya and freelance journalist Ishmael 
Mafundikwa, were charged with violating Section 17 of 
the Public Order and Security Act.  Section 17 deals 
with inciting or participating in public violence. 
The two remain in police custody on February 4 but, 
according to relatives, have not been mistreated.  Mr. 
Mafundikwa's lawyer hopes her client will have a 
hearing on February 4. 
 
  ¶2.   Police initially barred all non-government 
journalists from court.  Reporters from government- 
owned print and electronic media were given access. 
After an urgent request by the defense lawyers, 
presiding judge Paddington Garwe ruled that the trial 
must be "held in public" and "interested parties 
should be allowed in court unless they are barred by 
the court."  After the judge's ruling, only those 
journalists with valid press cards issued under the 
controversial Access to Information and Protection of 
Privacy Act (AIPPA).  This still amounted to a partial 
ban on non-government media as most foreign 
correspondents and journalists from the independent 
media have yet to receive accreditation. 
 
  ¶3.   In the chaotic scene outside of the court 
before the trial began, American journalist Andrew 
Meldrum (has permanent resident status in Zimbabwe) 
was pushed and shoved by police and hit over the head 
with a police baton.  Mr. Meldrum told Embassy officer 
that he was not seriously hurt.
