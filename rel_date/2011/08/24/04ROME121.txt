(U) ACCORDING TO CONTACTS AT THE MFA IRAQ TASK FORCE, THE 
ITALIAN TREASURY, AND (WE ARE TOLD) THE ITALIAN 
REPRESENTATIVE'S OFFICE AT THE WORLD BANK, ITALY DOES NOT 
APPEAR LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IFC IRAQ SMALL BUSINESS 
FACILITY (REF A).  IN GENERAL, THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT IS MUCH 
MORE FOCUSED ON BILATERAL THAN ON MULTILATERAL INVOLVEMENT IN 
IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION.  SEE REFTEL B.
