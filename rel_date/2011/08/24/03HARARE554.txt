SUBJECT: PRO-GOVERNMENT DAILY FAULTS ZIMBABWE'S 
CONTINUED SUSPENSION FROM COMMONWEALTH 
 
  ¶1.   Under headline "Stayaways and sanctions will not 
      solve our problems" the pro-government daily "The 
      Daily Mirror" offered a March 18 editorial criticizing 
      the Commonwealth for extending Zimbabwe's suspension, 
      saying the move was "unwise" and "also dampens 
      homegrown efforts to find a solution to our problems." 
      Excerpts: 
 
  ¶2.   "The announcement by the Commonwealth Secretary 
      General, Don McKinnon yesterday that the 
      Commonwealth was renewing sanctions (sic) 
      against Zimbabwe came as a shock to many.  The 
      decision seems to have been taken without 
      consensus of African members of the 
      Commonwealth, raising serious doubts about its 
      validity.  Although the hostility of white 
      members of this group towards Zimbabwe, and 
      President Mugabe in particular, is well known, 
      this harsh measure was, without doubt, unwise. 
      Not only does it go against the spirit of 
      political reconciliation, which various eminent 
      personalities from around the world have been 
      trying to foster.  It also dampens homegrown 
      efforts to find a solution to our problems. . ."
