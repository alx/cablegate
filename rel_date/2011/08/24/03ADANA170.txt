¶2. Milliyet, Hurriyet, Radikal, / Regional 
officials say Mardin should be in the World 
Heritage List for year 2004. Mardin 
Governer had withdrawn Mardin's application 
for the World Heritage List due to some 
unplanned building sites around historical 
buildings. (Editor's Commend: As these 
buildings change the historical look of the 
city they may affect the presence of Mardin 
in the list). Abdulkadir Tutasi, the Mayor 
of Mardin, announced that they are planning 
to remove the apartments around the 
historical houses by 2004.
