BEGIN TEXT MFA NOTE: 
 
 
NOTE ON TURKISH CONTRIBUTION TO AFGHANISTAN RECONSTRUCTION 
EFFORT 
 
 
Turkey's pledge for the year 2002 was 1 million USD. 500 
thousand USD of this amount was transfered to Afghanistan 
Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) on September 24, 2002 
(another 100 thousand USD, paid to the Afghanistan Interim 
Authority Fund/Emergency Fund previously, is not included in 
this calculation), and the remaining 500 thousand USD was 
spent for bilateral projects. 
 
 
At the end of the year, Turkish contribution far exceeded her 
pledge of 1 million USD and reached 2,868,716 USD, which 
means an additional expenditure of 1,868,716 USD (1,000,000 
plus 1,868,716 equals 2,868,716 USD).  This being the case 
the total amount spent for "bilateral projects" in 2002 is 
2,368,716 USD (500,000 pledged plus 1,868,716 equals 
2,368,716 USD). 
 
 
This figure does not include the expenditures made in the 
security sector.  In addition to 425,000 USD spent within the 
framework of ISAF/CIMIC activities and 430,662 USD spent for 
the formation of the Afghan National Army, "direct project 
assistance" was rendered by the Turkish Armed Forces in 
accordance with the bilateral cooperation agreement.  The 
total cost of the "project assistance" will be calculated 
soon.

2002 to February 2003.  End Embassy note. 
 
 
¶5. Minimize considered.
