(SBU) Chief of Marketing for Turkish Airlines (THY), Guliz 
Ozturk, confirmed to econoff March 25 that THY had suspended 
operations to Kuwait and Bahrain due to insufficient 
passenger loads and proximity to the area of military 
operations.  She said the airline had also suspended flights 
within Turkey to Mardin, Sanliurfa, and Gaziantep, because 
flights to these cities were not permitted by the Prime 
Ministry's Crisis Center.  Ozturk said the suspension of the 
flights within Turkey had nothing to do with the reported 
U.S. missile that had landed in southeastern Turkey, as had 
been rumored.  (Note:  These cancellations track with THY's 
pre-operation planning, as reported reftels).
