¶1.  IMMEDIATELY UPON MY RETURN TO POST, I SPOKE WITH 
WORLD FOOD PROGRAM (WFP) EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JIM MORRIS ON 
THURSDAY, MAY 29, 2003 CONCERNING WFP'S PURCHASE OF IRAQI 
WHEAT.  I EMPHASIZED THAT VERY RAPID ACTION IS CRITICAL. 
THE ATTENTION OF THE WORLD IS ON THE SITUATION IN IRAQ 
RIGHT NOW AND SPEED, COORDINATION AND EFFECTIVENESS ARE 
REQUIRED. 
 
¶2.  JIM MORRIS TOLD ME THAT WFP HAS JUST FINALIZED A USD 
152 MILLION COMMITMENT TO BUY THE WHEAT.  THEY BELIEVE -- 
AND I SHARE THEIR VIEW -- THAT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS 
PROJECT STARTED ABOUT A WEEK AGO, THAT IS VERY QUICK 
    TURNAROUND.  THE PURCHASE PRICE OF USD 105/METRIC TON WAS 
JUST FINALIZED ON MAY 22.  THEY ARE GRATEFUL THAT THEY 
WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH IN SO LITTLE TIME. 
 
¶3.  THEY UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY.  WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE 
NEED FOR WFP TO DEMONSTRATE ONCE AGAIN THAT THEY ARE UP 
TO THE JOB.  TWENTY PERCENT OF THEIR PROFESSIONL STAFF 
IS DEVOTED TO IRAQ AND IS IN THE REGION,IN ADDITION TO 
SENIOR LEADERSHIP AT HEADQUARTERS  GIVEN THEIR 
EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE IN AVERTNG WIDESPREAD 
STARVATION IN AFGHANISTAN, AND THEI WORK SO FAR IN 
PROVIDING FOOD AID TO MILLIONS OF IRAQIS, OUR 
EXPECTATIONS ARE NOT UNREASONABLE. 
 
¶4.  WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT LINES OF COMMUNICATIONS ARE 
OPEN BETWEEN THE FIELD AND ROME; THAT WE ARE ABLE TO 
SATISFY WFP'S REQUESTS OF US FOR ASSISTANCE; THAT IN- 
COUNTRY CAPABILITY  -- IN PARTICULAR, OUR MISSION'S 
SENIOR HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR, REGINA DAVIS, CURRENTLY 
ON THE USAID DART TEAM IN IRAQ -- IS FULLY UTILIZED; AND 
THAT THE DAY-TO-DAY PROBLEMS INHERENT WITH AN OPERATION 
OF THIS SIZE DO NOT BECOME MAJOR ISSUES.    HALL
