POLITICAL, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
 
 
¶2.  Milliyet:  Ankara is undertaking a major 
legal arrangement to bring PKK militants down 
from the mountains because it is not being 
satisfied with the results of the "repent law" 
for dissolving the PKK.  The expanded legal 
arrangements, which aim to contribute to social 
reconciliation, have been made in light of the 
evaluations at the summit of the state to 
eradicate the terrorist components and their 
arms. The projects has also been evaluated at the 
National Security Council, and it is assessed 
that such an arrangement will become more 
effective to enhance the national security 
because of the likely political atmosphere and 
structure taking place in postwar Iraq.  Ending 
the chaotic situation and filling the vacuum of 
authority in the region will also encourage the 
PKK/KADEK militants to benefit from the new 
repent law. Officials said that previous repent 
laws were unfruitful, and the desired results 
were not attained from them despite distribution 
of thousands of handouts by helicopters to the 
militants in the mountains.  The current repent 
law would give short-term light sentences 
followed by pardoning the militants. 
 
 
¶3.  Hurriyet:  Turkey sought an amicable solution 
to four arson and mysterious killing cases 
handled at the European Court of Human Rights

victims of the four cases.  Huseyin Ates, whose 
house was set on fire in 1994 will be paid 49,000 
Euros; Zeki Yildiz, who was attacked by wardens 
in Buca prison of Izmir, 30,500 Euros; Beyaz 
Macir, whose husband was killed by the security 
forces, 70,000 Euros; and Zahide Guler, whose
