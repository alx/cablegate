¶2.  Evrensel/Hurriyet: PKK/KADEK leader Abdullah 
Ocalan, who had not been able to meet with his 
family and lawyers for 12 weeks, was granted the 
chance this week.  The meeting did not come off, 
however. His lawyers from Asrin Hukuk Burosu -- 
Dogan Erbas, Firat Aydinkaya, and Aysel Tugluk - 
along with his sister, Hava Keser, came to Gemlik 
and boarded the Turkish-government's boat for 
Imrali island, where Ocalan is imprisoned. 
Halfway between Gemlik and Imrali, the seas 
became rough, and the boat turned around. 
Acording to Hurriyet, a five-page report giving 
information about PKK/KADEK's situation and 
prospects in the event of war on Iraq was found 
sandwiched between newspapers that were being 
carried by attorney Aysel Tugluk for Ocalan. 
Turgluk explained that the report might have been 
put among the papers by employees at the legal 
office.  The papers reported several incidents 
throughout the region protesting either war 
and/or Ocalan's isolation, including Van, 
Diyarbakir, and Gaziantep. 
 
 
¶3.  Radikal/Cumhuriyet/Hurriyet: The final list 
of candidates who will run in the by elections in

According to Hurriyet, HADEP has offered 
conditional support to CHP in by elections in 
Siirt province. CHP's Vice Chairman, Cevdet 
Selvi, said HADEP officials told him that if 
CHP's chair, Deniz Baykal made an announcement 
criticizing Abdullah Ocalan's isolation in Imrali 
and his not being allowed to meet with his family 
members, CHP would find great sympathy among 
their ranks and files. Selvi said HADEP 
supporters would vote for CHP in masses if such 
an announcement were made.

full speed.  In Batman, 50 heavy-duty 
construction vehicles rented by the US have

Military Airport in the last three days. 
 
 
¶6.  Turkiye/Dunya: Turkey recalled its Ambassador
