BRIEFING 
Ambassador Edelman's Visit to PM Erdogan:  All papers and TV 
channels cover Ambassador Edelman's visit to PM Erdogan. 
"Hurriyet" reports that the meeting had originally been 
planned for 45 minutes, however, it lasted for almost an 
hour and half, and caused a French delegation, waiting to 
see PM, to wait longer.  "Hurriyet" notes that at the 
meeting, US could not give clear responses on PKK/KADEK 
issue.  The Prime Ministry statement, issued after the 
meeting, said `Mr. Prime Minister stressed that fighting 
terrorism should not remain rhetorical, instead, it should 
be supported by concrete steps.  PM stressed that providing 
stability in Iraq would benefit both Turkey and US. 
Therefore, Turkey wants to understand clearly what will be 
done in this process, by whom, how, where and when.' 
"Zaman" reports that Amb. Edelman said that `the US respects 
Turkey's decision process for the troop deployment in Iraq.' 
Barzani Remarks:   In an interview with a German paper, KDP 
leader Barzani said that they have no objections to the 
deployment of international peacekeeping forces in Iraq, 
however, they were against the troop deployment from the 
neighboring countries, including Turkey. 
Use of Turkish Air Space by the US:  "Turkiye" reports that 
the permission for the use of Turkish air space for the US 
expires on September 20.  Since the parliament is on recess 
until October 1, the government is looking for possibilities 
to extend the permission without passing a new motion by 
parliament.  According to "Milliyet" the government has 
already made the necessary arrangements and with a secret 
decree issued by FM Gul on June 23, US planes will be 
allowed to use Turkish airspace for humanitarian purposes 
only. 
EU Declines to Add KADEK to its Terror List:  All papers 
report that the EU had declined to add KADEK to its 
terrorist list with the reason that KADEK had not carried 
out any terror attacks yet. 
EDITORIAL OPINION: 
"Would Turkish troops face attack in Iraq?" 
Cengiz Candar opined in mass appeal DB-Tercuman (9/17): "A 
large majority of the Iraqis are against Turkish troop 
presence in Iraq.  However, Americans want Turks in Iraq. . 
Remnants of the old Iraqi regime, Baath followers, and 
fundamentalists including the Wahabi will not hesitate to 
attack Turkish soldiers. .  Each attack resulting in a 
Turkish injury is likely to cause new cracks in Turkey - 
U.S. relations and in domestic Turkish politics. .  It is 
not that important whether the Iraqis want Turkish troops or 
not.  No matter if our politicians like it or not, Turkish 
soldiers will go to Iraq as a police force. .  Iraq 
currently needs a peacemaking mission, not a peacekeeping 
task. .  As David Ignatius of the WP put it, the old Turkey 
- U.S. relationship was a remnant of the Cold War and died 
on March 1.  With their decisions regarding Iraq, the two 
countries are now outlining the principles of a new 
relationship." 
 
 
"U.S. ought to intervene on PKK" 
Mustafa Karaalioglu commented in Islamist intellectual Yeni 
Safak (9/17): "U.S. cannot talk the PKK into benefiting from 
the Repentance Law.  U.S. must physically intervene on the 
PKK and remove it from being a threat in Northern Iraq. . 
U.S., UK, Poland, Bulgaria and, although indirectly, Israel 
are in Iraq, and we cannot simply watch and do nothing, says 
Foreign Minister Gul. .  Groups that have political 
interests in Iraq are uncomfortable that Turkey will be 
going to Iraq not as an ordinary member of the international 
community, but as a neighbor sharing the same religion and 
culture.  They won't be able to enjoy a comfortable margin 
of movement while Turkey is there, and are concerned that a 
Turkey interested in the current situation in Iraq will not 
remain aloof to the country's future. .  Turkey's duration 
of stay under a roadmap in Iraq is equally as important as 
the decision to deploy troops."
