The Netherlands continues to strongly support a third 
committee resolution on Iran, and persists in encouraging 
other EU member states to agree to put forth such a 
resolution (refs c,d).  PolOff conveyed reftel to Jeroen van 
Drunen, Senior Policy Advisor in the MFA's Human Rights 
Department.  Van Drunen commented that while there is more 
support within the EU for an Iran resolution now than at the 
same time last year, much reluctance remains in the 
Mediterranean states.  He expects a decision in early 
September.
