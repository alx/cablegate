SUBJECT:  GOVERNMENT WITNESS IMPLICATES U.S. 
GOVERNMENT IN ALLEGED ASSASSINATION PLOT 
 
REF: Harare 259, Harare 230 
 
  ¶1.   The February 6 edition of the government-owned 
     "Herald" newspaper reports that Ari Ben-Menashe, the 
     government's star witness in the treason trial of 
     opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai and two other 
     opposition leaders, claimed in court that he believed 
     the U.S. Government knew of the alleged assassination 
     plot against Robert Mugabe and that he believed that a 
     participant in one of his meetings with Tsvangirai was 
     a CIA official.  The "Herald" plays these claims to 
     the hilt, running the page-one story under the banner 
     headline "Key Witness Names CIA."  Copies of the 
     article have been faxed to AF/S and AF/PDPA. 
 
  ¶2.    According to Mr. Ben Menashe, participants in 
     the alleged conspiracy to rid Zimbabwe of Robert 
     Mugabe now include former President Clinton, the 
     "Jewish community in America" and the CIA, among a 
     long and generalized list of other groups and 
     individuals.  Mr. Ben-Menashe offers Defense attorney 
     George Bizos fertile ground for cross-examination.
