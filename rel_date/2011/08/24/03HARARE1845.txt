SUBJECT: MEDIA REPORT SUPREME COURT ORDERS DAILY NEWS TO 
REGISTER; HARARE 
 
 
Zimbawe's Supreme Court has ruled that the Associated 
Newspapers of Zimbabwe (ANZ), publishers of the independent 
"The Daily News" and its sister weekly "The Daily News on 
Sunday," must register with the Media and Information 
Commission (MIC).  Under the controversial Access to 
Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA), 
promulgated by government last year, all media 
organizations operating in Zimbabwe are required to 
register with the Commission headed by Dr. Tafataona 
Mahoso.  In his judgment, Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku 
said the newspaper group is operating outside the law and 
must comply with the AIPPA before challenging it 
constitutionality.  The ANZ was challenging requirement of 
media houses to register with a government appointed MIC as 
prescribed under Section 66 of AIPPA.  In a 14-page 
judgment, the Supreme Court ruled, "citizens are obliged to 
obey the law and argue afterwards."  ANZ's legal consel 
stated that the media house intended to comply with AIPPA 
as required by the Supreme Court ruling and then to renew 
their court challenge to its constitutionality.
