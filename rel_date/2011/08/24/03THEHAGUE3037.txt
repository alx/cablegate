¶1.     The Dutch Ministry of Finance announced on November 27 
that it would make available export credit insurance for Iraq 
totaling EUR 25 million, valid for 180 days.  As reported in 
ref A, the package will be managed by private insurer Gerling 
NCM.  Gerling NCM participated in the December 5 meeting of 
export credit agencies in Rome (ref C) and is a signatory to 
the agreement with the Trade Bank of Iraq. 
 
¶2.     In a letter to parliament, Minister of Finance Gerrit 
Zalm said the facility has the dual purpose of helping Iraq's 
reconstruction and creating export opportunities for Dutch 
companies.  Zalm noted that access to international capital 
markets is essential to Iraq's reconstruction.  The facility 
features a cap of EUR 5 million per transaction, in an effort 
to prevent one company from enjoying a disproportionate share.
