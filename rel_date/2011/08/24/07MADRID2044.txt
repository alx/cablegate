SCANNING REQUIREMENTS 
REF: STATE 119837 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Although GOS officials are in favor of 
increasing security measures at Spanish ports, they are 
concerned that their ports will be unable to comply with the 
new scanning requirements mandated under Title XVII of the 
9/11 Act.  Spanish officials have told Post that the 
requirement to x-ray 100 percent of U.S.-bound cargo would be 
both time and cost prohibitive.  In response, EconOff has 
drawn from the reftel points, highlighting the President's 
desire to ensure the workability of the cargo scanning 
provisions in a way that increases homeland security while 
ensuring the continuance of vital commerce.  GOS officials 
have expressed appreciation for the information, but say they 
will continue to coordinate with other EU countries to craft 
a common stance in opposition to these new requirements.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Over the past several weeks, officials from Spanish 
Customs as well as from the Ministry of Infrastructure and 
Public Works' Port Safety Directorate have told Embassy 
officers that they are concerned with the feasibility of 
implementing the 9/11 Act's cargo scanning provisions, 
particularly the requirement to x-ray all of U.S.-bound 
cargo.  Drawing from Spain's experience with the Container 
Security Initiative (CSI), Spanish Customs representatives 
have pointed out that the process of x-raying cargo is not a 
quick one, and takes several minutes per container to 
complete.  Given the number of containers that come through 
Spanish ports, customs officials believe that the time, 
personnel, and equipment needed to identify and x-ray all 
U.S.-bound cargo (instead of the targeted screening that 
currently takes place in major Spanish ports) would be time 
and cost prohibitive. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Ignacio Gonzalez, Spanish Customs' Assistant 
Director for Customs Surveillance, has noted that scanning 
for illicit nuclear or other radioactive material would be 
logistically more feasible than 100 percent x-raying, 
although still a costly endeavor.  He explained that with the 
purchase of enough Megaports radiation detection portals, 
trucks could theoretically drive large volumes of cargo on 
their way in and out of ports without significant delays. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Pedro Roman, Director for Port Security at the 
Ministry of Infrastructure, repeated these concerns in a 
conversation with EconOff October 24.  He stated that all EU 
countries were opposed to these measures and that Spain was 
in the process of working with the EU to craft a common 
stance.  He added that he would be participating in EU 
discussions on this common position, the next meeting of 
which is scheduled in Brussels the week of November 5. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In response to the various concerns raised, EconOff 
has drawn from reftel talking points, noting that in signing 
the law, the President stated that he will continue to work 
with Congress to ensure the workability of the cargo 
screening provisions in a way that increases our vigilance on 
homeland security while ensuring the continuance of vital 
commerce.  EconOff has also noted that the Act provides the 
Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security the 
 
SIPDIS 
flexibility to seek extensions of the 2012 deadline until the 
specific conditions necessary for a full deployment can be 
met. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Spanish officials have attempted to clarify that 
although the GOS is opposed to the cargo scanning provisions 
of this law, it is supportive of the principle of increased 
security.  Ignacio Gonzalez from Spanish Customs explained to 
Embassy officers that GOS is in favor of additional security 
measures at Spanish ports, and is seeking to expand the 
Megaports initiative to detect illicit radioactive material. 
He added that three of the most heavy volume ports in Spain - 
Barcelona, Valencia, and Algeciras - were actively 
participating in targeted cargo screening efforts undertaken 
via the Container Security Initiative (CSI). 
 
¶7. (SBU) Comment: Post will continue to engage with the GOS 
on this issue.  So far, the only complaints heard about this 
initiative have come from GOS officials, although we expect 
members of the local maritime and business community to also 
add their views following the October 25 Financial Times 
 
articles on these new measures.
