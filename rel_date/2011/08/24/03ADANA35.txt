POLITICS, SECURITY, HUMAN RIGHTS 
-------------------------------- 
 
 
¶2.  MERVAN GUL IS RESIGNING TO OPEN WAY FOR 
ERDOGAN 
(Milliyet)  AK Party is pressing the button today 
(1/31) to make it possible for its leader Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan to become prime minister.  Mervan 
Gul, AK Party's first-listed candidate in the 
March 9 Siirt elections, is submitting his 
resignation to the Higher Election Council (YSK) 
today, to step aside for Erdogan.  Erdogan's 
name, instead of Gul's, will be reported to YSK 
by February 6.  AK Party has decided that there 
is no need for its two other Siirt candidates to 
resign. 
 
 
¶3.  WAR PREPARATIONS AT INCIRLIK 
(Radikal)  While the U.S. is counting days prior 
to a possible attack against Iraq, foodstuffs and 
water are being stockpiled at the Incirlik Air 
Base (Adana).  U.S. officials are buying drinking 
water from Pinar Group, an affiliate of the Yasar 
Holding Food Group.  Yasar Holding Food Group 
President Ahmet Arsan pointed to increased demand 
(for his water) from the Southeast and provinces 
along the Iraqi border.  Adana Bar Association 
President Necati Erdem described the developments 
regarding a possible Iraq operation as worrisome. 
Hurriyet reported increased exercises at 
Incirlik, where U.S. and British passenger planes 
landed for military personnel transfer. 
Cumhuriyet reported many planes landed at 
Incirlik, while journalists were trying to film 
developments there. 
 
 
¶4.  ANTI-WAR SENTIMENTS 
(Bolge/Milliyet)  Ali Batman, President of the 
Adana chapter of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable 
Merchants Chamber, claimed war rumors have had a 
negative impact on the fresh fruit and vegetable 
sector, leading to the suspension of business 
activities of 110 merchants over the past two 
months.  In a meeting at the Mersin chapter of 
the Turkish Agriculturalists' Association, the 
Association's National President, Ibrahim Yetkin, 
said the agricultural sector would be most 
affected in the event of U.S.-led war in Iraq. 
Nearly 20 members of the Adana Bar Association 
gathered in Adana's Ataturk Park to protest the 
possible U.S.-led war in Iraq.  Hurriyet reported 
that fifth graders of Adana's Hurriyet Primary 
School scribbled "No To War" and "Yes To Peace" 
on sheets of paper and displayed them on their 
classroom windows.  Turkiye quoted Adana 
researcher-historian Ejder Dilci as saying that 
history was repeating itself regarding Iraq, 
against which the U.S. is preparing to launch an 
operation.  According to Dilci, Germany asked 
Turkey for permission to enter Iraq through 
Turkey in 1941.  He added that U.S. had requested 
permission from the Turkish government to enter 
Iraq.  Evrensel reported that Mersin merchants 
would wear black ribbons today (1/31) to say "No" 
to war. 
 
 
¶5.  MERSIN PORT CLOSED TO FISHERMEN 
(Evrensel)  Fishing around the Mersin Port, which 
the U.S. wants to use during a possible attack 
against Iraq, has been banned since January 27. 
A U.S. delegation had previously surveyed the 
port.  Fishermen criticized the ban, saying "we 
cannot freely move about and fish in our seas." 
 
 
¶6.  INCREASED MILITARY ACTIVITIES IN CIZRE 
(SIRNAK) 
Hurriyet and Milliyet reported increased 
activities at the Cizre (Sirnak) Tank Battalion, 
following the dispatch by the Turkish General 
Staff (TGS) of additional equipment and materials 
to the Diyarbakir-based Second Army, which is 
responsible for the Iraqi border.  Some of the 
Battalion's tanks are now in open fields ready 
for deployment along the border.  Also, military 
vehicles have begun to dispatch foodstuffs from 
Cizre to units along the border.  Evrensel cited 
Sirnak Governor Huseyin Baskaya as saying that an 
exercise would soon be carried out near the 
province's Habur border gate against a possible 
influx of Iraqi refugees in the aftermath of a 
possible U.S.-led operation against Iraq. 
 
 
¶7.  DEPLOYMENT ALONG IRAQI BORDER 
(Cumhuriyet)  Military units, following the 
abolition of the State of Emergency (OHAL) in the 
Southeast, are being re-deployed to the Iraqi 
border.  Military units affiliated with the Van 
Public Order Command, the Kayseri Airborne 
Command, the 18th Border Command, and the Third 
Army have been dispatched to Sirnak through Van. 
Milliyet reported that "critical" personnel who 
had been transferred from the (Malatya-based) 
Second Army to Western provinces might sent back 
to Malatya on TDY or re-appointed to their 
previous positions. 
 
 
¶8.  BODY OF BRITISH VICTIM OF PLANE CRASH 
MISTAKENLY BURIED IN ISTANBUL

Ringland, who lost his life during a plane crash 
in Diyarbakir earlier this month, was reportedly 
mistaken for that of businessman Nurullah Eren, 
who was owner of the Eren Holding Company and the 
Turkish Lacoste firm.  The body had been buried 
at the Karacaahmet Cemetery in Istanbul.  When 
officials found out about the error, Ringland's

Massacre in History" conference jointly organized 
by the Adana Governor's Office, the Ceyhan 
(Adana) district Governor's Office, and the Adana 
National Education Directorate, researcher- 
historian Cezmi Yurtsever claimed that Armenians 
were trying to misrepresent the massacres they 
carried out in Cukurova (Adana) and Anatolia 
between 1892-1922 as if they themselves had been 
subjected to those massacres.  In those years, 
Armenians attacked Camili village, Adana's 
largest village, and tortured hundreds of people 
to death. 
 
 
¶19.  "PULUMUR RESIDENTS FREEZING TO DEATH"

Tunceli Governor Huseyin Baskaya said damage 
assessment works have been completed in 28 of 
Pulumur's 38 villages.  According to a 
preliminary report, 12 private and six public 
buildings were strongly damaged; 46 private and 
83 public buildings were moderately damaged, 
while 75 private and 48 public buildings were 
slightly damaged.  Turkiye reported that summer 
tents had been replaced with winter tents. 
Officials are trying to convince earthquake

prefer to stay with relatives and neighbors.

(Bolge)  Public employees, all members of labor

Babacan.  KESK Adana Term President Ahmet Kilic 
said "the payroll deductions were employees' 
money, not a loan given to the State."
