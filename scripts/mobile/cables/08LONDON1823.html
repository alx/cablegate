(C) Per reftel, the Charge spoke on July 9 with FCO Minister for Africa Lord Malloch-Brown, who was optimistic there would be sufficient votes to pass the current UNSC draft resolution on Zimbabwe.  Malloch-Brown suggested progress had been made with Moscow and Beijing in New York and at the G-8 Summit in Japan.  In his view, China will likely do the right thing because it does not want another human rights fight on its hands before the Olympics.  Russia, however, was more problematic.  President Medevev agreed to the G-8 Summit statement that implied sanctions, but seemed to walk back from that in statements he made today.  FCO Zimbabwe Desk Ben Llewellyn-Jones told us that the PM,s Foreign Policy Advisor, Simon MacDonald, called his Russian counterpart to lobby in favor of the resolution, but did not receive any assurances.  When directly asked, the Russians did not say if they would veto.  Given the current frosty UK-Russia relations, Malloch-Brown said USG engagement with the Russians might be more effective.  He also questioned if Moscow would really want to use its veto on this issue.  
</p><p>¶2. (C) Malloch-Brown said Ouagadougou is "on our side" from what the UK Embassy in Burkina Faso is reporting, but that the Zimbabwean Foreign Minister's visit will test the depth of that commitment.  On Libya, Malloch-Brown said that UK Foreign Secretary Miliband had telephoned the Libyan Foreign Minister, who was ambiguous but promised to be as supportive as possible.
