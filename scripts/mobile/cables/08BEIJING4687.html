------- 
</p><p>¶1. (C) China is "gravely concerned" by statements that the 
United States is considering transferring PRC citizen Uighurs 
detained at Guantanamo to a third country rather than 
repatriating them to China, Assistant Foreign Minister Liu 
Jieyi told the Ambassador December 29. The Uighur detainees 
are members of a UN-listed terrorist organization, the East 
Turkestan Islamic Movement, and as such should be given to 
China to be dealt with under Chinese law, he said. The 
United States should not allow Taiwan Legislative Yuan 
President Wang Jyng-ping to lead an "official delegation" to 
the United States for the upcoming U.S. presidential 
inauguration, Liu said. The Ambassador responded that the 
administration is not inviting delegations from abroad, but 
rather only representatives of the Washington-based 
diplomatic corps, to the inauguration. The Ambassador raised 
concerns regarding the continued detention of Charter 08 
signer and organizer Liu Xiaobo and urged the Chinese 
Government to release him and stop harassing peaceful 
dissidents. Liu responded that the issue of Liu Xiaobo is 
one of rule of law rather than of human rights, and that the 
case is being dealt with in keeping with Chinese law. End 
Summary. 
</p><p>"Chinese Uighur Terrorists in Guantanamo" 
----------------------------------------- 
</p><p>¶2. (C) Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Jieyi called the 
Ambassador into the Foreign Ministry December 29 to 
officially record China's "grave concern" over the State 
Department spokesperson's December 23 statements that 
repatriating Chinese Uighurs held in Guantanamo to China 
would not be prudent and furthermore that the USG appreciates 
the consideration given by Germany, Portugal, France, 
Switzerland and other European states to accepting these 
individuals. The suspects are members of the East Turkestan 
Islamic Movement (ETIM), a group listed by the UN Security 
Council (UNSC) Resolution 1267 committee as a terrorist 
organization, AFM Liu alleged. Furthermore, the U.S. 
Department of Justice has indicated that the suspects 
acknowledged in interviews that, when captured, they were in 
Afghanistan for weapons training to fight the Chinese 
Government. As such, the Uighur detainees should be returned 
to China "as a matter of course" so that they can be dealt 
with in keeping with Chinese law. Transferring them to a 
third country would violate the relevant UNSC resolutions, 
would not be in keeping with the United States' international 
commitments, would harm China's judicial sovereignty and 
national security, and could end up being a risk to U.S. 
security as terrorists sometimes turn their focus from one 
nation to another, Liu said. 
</p><p>¶3. (C) China believes U.S.-China counter-terrorism 
cooperation should be based on reciprocity and mutual benefit 
and therefore opposes transferring the Uighur detainees to a 
third country. Noting that Sino-U.S. relations are at an 
important "moment of transition," he urged the United States 
to consider overall bilateral relations, our common 
counter-terrorism interests and the "utmost sensitivity" of 
the issue and repatriate the individuals to China. Doing so 
would avoid harm to bilateral relations and to cooperation 
"in important areas." AFM Liu also urged the USG to advise 
the incoming administration of the importance of this issue. 
The Ambassador took note of PRC concerns. 
</p><p>Taiwan Inauguration Delegation 
------------------------------ 
</p><p>¶4. (C) China is "extremely concerned" by reports in the 
Taiwan press that Taiwan's "so-called" Legislative Yuan 
President Wang Jyng-ping will "lead an official delegation" 
to the United States for the January 20 inauguration, Liu 
said. Furthermore, the delegation may include opposition 
party DPP representative Annette Lu, whom he described as 
"bent on Taiwanese independence." Noting that Taiwan is the 
most sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations and that China's 
one-China principle "cannot change," Liu said that China 
firmly opposes official exchanges between the United States 
and Taiwan. As the inauguration is an important and official 
event, participation by the delegation and Annette Lu would 
</p><p>BEIJING 00004687 002 OF 002 
</p><p></p><p>be a serious violation of the One China policy and the three 
Joint Communiques, would "send a seriously wrong signal" to 
Taiwan independence forces, and would interfere with 
bilateral and cross-Strait relations, Liu said. He urged the 
United States to recognize the sensitivity and complexity of 
the Taiwan issue and not allow the delegation or Annette Lu 
or other "independence characters" to attend, nor to conduct 
any official U.S.-Taiwan exchanges, and to advise the 
incoming administration and Congress of the sensitivity of 
the issue. Liu added that the United States should guard 
against allowing Wang and the delegation to travel to the 
United States and to characterize the trip as "official." 
</p><p>¶5. (C) The Ambassador responded that while representatives of 
the Washington-based diplomatic corps are invited to the 
inauguration, no delegations are invited from abroad. As 
such, there are no "official" foreign delegations attending 
at the invitation of the Administration. 
</p><p>Human Rights: Charter 08 and Liu Xiaobo 
--------------------------------------- 
</p><p>¶6. (C) The Ambassador raised U.S. concerns regarding the 
continued detention of dissident writer and rights activist 
Liu Xiaobo (reftel), a signer of and organizer behind the 
Charter 08 democracy manifesto issued in conjunction with 
international Human Rights Day December 10. The Ambassador 
noted deep U.S. concern regarding reports that Chinese 
citizens have been detained, interrogated and harassed as 
they prepared to commemorate Human Rights Day and the 60th 
anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. He stressed particular concern regarding the 
well-being of Liu, who remains in custody and called on the 
Chinese Government to release Liu and cease harassment of all 
Chinese citizens who peacefully express the desire for 
internationally recognized fundamental freedoms. 
</p><p>¶7. (C) AFM Liu responded that this issue is a rule of law 
issue, not a human rights issue and expressed certitude that 
the case would be dealt with in accordance with PRC law. He 
disagreed with the U.S. assertions as to what should be done 
with Liu and any others on the grounds that the only 
determinant for the correct handling of the matter will be 
PRC law. Furthermore, AFM Liu stated, the Chinese Government 
does not accept outside interference in China's internal 
affairs.
