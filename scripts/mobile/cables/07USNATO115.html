</p><p>END SUMMARY. 
</p><p>¶2. Afghanistan 
-------------- 
(C) The SYG expressed his condolences over recent U.S. troop 
losses. Moving to the agenda, he said NATO needs to take 
concrete steps to move ahead on its &comprehensive 
approach,8 and cited two areas for immediate action. The 
first would be the creation of a reconstruction and 
development database, with the aim of improving coordination 
between the many organizations involved. The SYG suggested 
keeping the database in Kabul, with the secretariat of the 
JCMB as the repository. NATO would not have a direct role in 
the project, but would contribute the information in its 
Afghanistan Country Stability database. SCR Daan Everts will 
take the lead in promoting this idea in Kabul. Second, the 
SYG recommended increased cooperation with the Japanese 
government on the comprehensive approach in Afghanistan. The 
SYG reported the GoJ will contribute 20 million dollars 
specifically for development projects in provinces where they 
currently have no bilateral projects, and will increase 
cooperation with key contacts as a result. Again, SCR Everts 
will work with the Japanese Embassy in Kabul to move this 
forward. Finally, the SYG reminded PermReps that he is 
traveling to Afghanistan with SACEUR, and will report upon 
his return. 
</p><p>¶3. (C) CMC Gen. Henault noted that manning issues for ISAF HQ 
X remain a concern with many important positions unfilled; 
total staffing has increased from 66% to 75%. In his 
operational update, Henault reported that 30 to 60 Taliban 
had moved from Helmand into southern Farah province, 
occupying a district center. The GoA had since regained 
control of the district. Henault speculated the Taliban 
</p><p>USNATO 00000115 002 OF 004 
</p><p></p><p>operation may have been related to counter narcotics 
operations in the area. He added the Taliban can be expected 
to carry out similar operations, occupying lightly-held 
districts until run off by ISAF or Afghan forces. This tactic 
has the advantage to the Taliban of undermining local 
governments, and gaining maximum publicity with minimal risk. 
Henault reported on a February 14 operation 10 kilometers 
east of Musa Qala, which resulted in the death of a Taliban 
commander. Operations are also ongoing to clear insurgent 
strongholds near the Kajaki dam. 
</p><p>¶4. (C) Cautioning that the information be closely held, 
Canadian PermRep Juneau reported his government is in 
discussions with the UAE to bring 130 soldiers from that 
country into Kandahar. The Emirates, he said, would deploy a 
SOF platoon and two infantry platoons (with troop carriers), 
most probably in Spin Boldak along the border with 
Baluchistan. They would arrive in April 2007, achieving FOC 
a month later. In addition, the Emirates will provide up to 
30 million dollars of development aid for Kandahar, for 
mosques, schools and health clinics. Noting the sensitive 
nature of the information, UK PermRep Eldon said Jordan will 
deploy 80 SOF troops to Helmand, where they will have a 
&normal8 (vice SF) role. The Belgian PermRep expressed 
concern that Afghan refugees may be forcibly evicted from 
refugee camps in Pakistan, then called for increased contact 
between NATO and the UNHCR. The German PermRep asked 
pointedly about the proposed establishment of an Afghan 
Development Zone near Kunduz, saying the recent meeting of 
the JCMB had agreed these are appropriate for southern 
Afghanistan, but not for the north. 
</p><p>¶5. (C) Eldon reported on Karzai,s February 14)15 visit to 
the UK, pointing out that, in his public statements, Karzai 
took pains not to criticize the Pakistani government, and 
instead emphasized conciliation between the two countries. 
Eldon suggested this may show a change in Karzai,s tactics, 
by handling problems with Pakistan in private rather than 
airing grievances publicly. The Italian representative added 
that, during a February 16)17 visit to Rome, Karzai 
emphasized the need for increased justice reform in 
Afghanistan, as well as more development funding, to include 
more work on the Kabul to Bamian road. Karzai also 
emphasized the need for Afghanistan's neighbors to play a 
role in stability in Afghanistan. 
</p><p>¶6. (S) Intelligence Division Assistant Director Admiral 
Clayton, in an intelligence briefing, reported that the 
Taliban, despite not winning any clear-cut battles, has 
nevertheless been able to increase its influence, 
particularly in southern Afghanistan. Helmand province 
continues to be the focus of the Taliban, where they are 
consolidating safe areas; they also hope to cut off or 
capture Kandahar city. The morale and confidence of fighters 
remains high. Funding to the Taliban has increased 
significantly over the last year, including from &Arab 
countries8, while revenues from the opium trade are likely 
to increase in 2007. In response to this discussion of 
Taliban funding from sources in Saudi Arabia, DCM noted the 
Saudi government had cooperated with the USG on terrorist 
financing and suggested the USG may be able to provide 
additional information to Allies. 
</p><p>Kosovo 
</p><p>USNATO 00000115 003 OF 004 
</p><p></p><p>------ 
¶7. (C) The ASYG reminded the Council today that U.N. Special 
Envoy Ahtisaari will host both Belgrade and Pristina 
negotiating teams in Vienna to begin their consultations on 
his status proposal. The CMC briefed that the security 
situation in Kosovo remains calm, but tense, noting the 
recent explosion of the three UNMIK vehicles on February 
19th. Leaders from Kosovo,s Unity Team visited Camp Nothing 
Hill where they received a briefing on KFOR,s readiness to 
maintain a safe and secure environment. The Slovenian 
PermRep announced that his country will be increasing its 
commitment to Kosovo by deploying a mechanized battalion of 
600 troops which will be located in Multi-National Task 
Force-West near the town of Pec. The force will be declared 
ready by March 1. The Spanish PermRep announced that his 
Foreign Minister, in his capacity as the OSCE representative, 
will visit both Belgrade and Pristina next week. 
</p><p>Darfur 
------ 
¶8. (SBU) The D/SYG reported on discussions between the 
C.A.R., Sudan, and Chad regarding insurgent groups operating 
within the three territories, and noted UN planning for a 
border monitoring mission along these countries, shared 
borders. Regarding Somalia, he said the increasing security 
vacuum there has put the African Union under pressure to plan 
for AMISOM, particularly given the impending arrival of 
Ugandan troops. If the AU wants support from NATO for this 
mission, it will need to provide specific requests beyond the 
generic note verbale sent in January. 
</p><p>¶9. (C) CMC Gen. Henault reported a battalion of Rwandan 
troops serving in AMIS are being rotated out using 
Algerian-provided aircraft, which should be completed as of 
February 21. The AU is expecting NATO to provide the lift to 
rotate two additional Rwandan battalions. Henault noted a 
joint NATO ) AU team has traveled to Khartoum to provide 
&lessons learned8 training at the Darfur Integrated Task 
Force HQ. The same team will subsequently provide similar 
training for the Force Headquarters in El Fashir. 
</p><p>Iraq 
---- 
¶10. (SBU) There was no substantive discussion on Iraq this 
week. 
</p><p>NATO Cooperation with UN and EU 
------------------------------- 
¶11. UK PermRep Eldon urged NATO to continue coordinating and 
cooperating with other organizations such as the UN and the 
EU. He suggested that NATO raise consciousness on issues 
currently affecting the UN. Dutch PermRep Schaper suggested 
NATO pay close attention to what value it could add to 
resolving issues being discussed in the UN or EU. 
</p><p>IBAN Annual Activities Report for 2005 
-------------------------------------- 
¶12. The IBAN report to Council focused on improving financial 
management at NATO, highlighting three substantial audit 
issues (including ACO and ACT); noting the progress made in 
auditing and closing NSIP projects; sharing the Board's 
expectation that not all agencies will be IPSAS compliant in 
2006 (resulting in more qualified audit opinions); and 
requesting the public release of the IBAN Annual Activities 
</p><p>USNATO 00000115 004 OF 004 
</p><p></p><p>Report in order to improve fiscal transparency.
