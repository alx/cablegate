</p><p>¶1. (U) This is an Action Request. See paragraph 5.
</p><p>SUMMARY
-------
¶2. (C) On October 23 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the
Government of Colombia (GOC) delivered its official response
to Embassy Bogota on the Defense Cooperation Agreement text
that we proposed on August 13. The GOC counterproposal is
generally consistent with prior GOC statements that any
agreement should: 1) avoid the use of the word "base;" 2)
place the agreement under the umbrella of existing bilateral
and multilateral accords to avoid the need for Colombian
congressional approval; and 3) provide U.S. security
assurances to the GOC as a "quid pro quo" for access rights.
Post has identified several problematic issues in the GOC
counterproposal, together with possible solutions that would
address our concerns while meeting GOC needs. Post requests
that the Department consider sending a technical negotiating
team to Bogota in the near future to begin formal
negotiations. An official translation of the GOC's
counterproposal is included in paragraph 6. End Summary.
</p><p>DRAFT CONSISTENT WITH GOC COMMENTS
----------------------------------
¶3. (C) The GOC's October 23 counterproposal is generally
consistent with remarks made to the Ambassador and other
senior Embassy officials by President Uribe, Defense Minister
Santos, and Foreign Minister Bermudez. These senior GOC
officials have said the proposed agreement should avoid the
use of the word "base," should be linked to earlier bilateral
and multilateral agreements to avoid the need for Colombian
congressional approval, and should provide U.S. security
assurances to the GOC as a "quid pro quo" for access rights.
President Uribe has also said he would like to conclude an
agreement before the end of the year.
</p><p>EMBASSY COMMENTS TO GOC DRAFT
-----------------------------
¶4. (C) Post believes it is important that in negotiating this
agreement with the GOC, we seek language that addresses our
concerns while being as responsive to the GOC's needs as
possible. In this context, Post has identified the following
issues with the GOC counterproposal--as well as possible
solutions--that will need to be addressed:
</p><p>ISSUE ONE: The GOC has included within the agreement's
preamble references to numerous existing bilateral and
multilateral agreements. The title has also been changed
from "Defense Cooperation Agreement" to "Supplemental
Agreement for Cooperation and Technical Assistance," in order
to place it under the umbrella of existing bilateral accords.
These edits are consistent with the GOC's goal of avoiding
the need for Colombian congressional approval. The changes
would also make it easier for the GOC to sell the agreement
to the Colombian public and the region as simply an extension
of our existing cooperation, rather than as a major
escalation in U.S. engagement. COMMENT: Post believes that
tying the agreement to existing bilateral and multilateral
agreements does not impact U.S. interests and is important to
the GOC's capacity to conclude an accord. If we can get the
access and authorities we need by changing the title, we
recommend changing the title.
</p><p>ISSUE TWO: The GOC-proposed Article III states that the
parties "agree to" undertake a number of measures to increase
cooperation and technical military cooperation in order to
"confront common threats to peace and stability." COMMENT:
To limit a possible open-ended U.S. security commitment under
this provision, Post suggests that we insert a less binding
verb such as "agree to study" or "agree to consider" in place
of "agree to."
</p><p>ISSUE THREE: The GOC draft of the second paragraph of
Article IV provides that the U.S. "guarantee rapid and direct
access" to the GOC of "goods and services necessary to
address "threats to its national security." COMMENT: To
avoid U.S. material being used in a potential regional
conflict, Post suggests that this language be amended to
</p><p>require that both the U.S. and Colombia need to agree on what
constitutes "threats to its national emergency," thus
effectively granting us a veto over the use of any U.S.
"goods or services" under this provision.
</p><p>ISSUE FOUR: The GOC draft of the third paragraph of Article
IV provides that within two years of signing the agreement,
the U.S. shall install and make operational "comprehensive
aerial defense systems" in order to provide necessary
security on the "agreed facilities and others of strategic
value for purposes," which systems shall transfer "free of
charge" to the GOC at the conclusion of the agreement. This
provision is clearly aimed at external threats, particularly
Venezuela. COMMENT: Post believes the GOC does not
appreciate the cost and scope entailed in building an
integrated air defense system, which could cost billions of
dollars and take years to develop. Post recognizes that the
proposed GOC language is unacceptable, and suggests that we
try to remove the provision from the agreement and deal with
it in the context of other bilateral discussions. If the GOC
insists on its inclusion, we propose a two-track approach in
which the U.S. would "commit to assess the operational
requirement for comprehensive air defense systems for use and
operation by the GOC," coupled with language in which the
U.S. would "commit to provide for the protection of USG
aircraft and personnel" (but not installations) in the event
of a threat to these assets. The latter provision should be
drafted to allow for all possible responses to protect USG
assets, including the withdrawal of such assets from Colombia
if necessary. Finally, we should begin to consider quietly
whether we would be prepared to provide some air defense
equipment to Colombia should that be the price of a DCA.
</p><p>ISSUE FIVE: The GOC has deleted the status of armed forces
(SOFA) language that we proposed. Instead, Article VI of the
GOC draft links privileges and immunities (P&I) to the 1974
agreement titled "Agreement Between the Government of the
United States of America and the Government of the Republic
of Colombia Concerning an Army Mission, a Naval Mission and
an Air Force Mission of the United States of America Armed
Forces in the Republic of Colombia" (commonly known as the
"1974 Agreement"). This again reflects the GOC's desire to
link to earlier agreements in an effort to avoid the need for
a Colombian congressional vote. COMMENT: The wording of
Article VI and the 1974 Agreement will need to be reviewed
carefully by technical experts, but Post believes that the
GOC approach represents an acceptable way forward. The
provisions in the 1974 Agreement--which also links to an
earlier 1962 bilateral accord--appear to provide technical
and administrative P&I to USG personnel, and as such would
meet the P&I needs provided for in our draft agreement.
</p><p>ISSUE SIX: Post proposes insertion of a new clause in
Article XVII wherein the parties would commit to sign a
technical Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) within 60 days of
signing the underlying agreement. The MOU would address more
detailed operational issues, thereby facilitating rapid and
seamless implementation of the underlying agreement.
</p><p>¶5. (C) Action Request. Post requests that the Department
consider sending a technical negotiating team to Bogota in
the near future to begin formal negotiations.
